Hi, I'm Philip Zucker!

I'm a physics/computer boy trying to find his place in the world. I try to keep this site fast and loose to encourage posting, sort of in the style of lab notebook. So, it's not always in the most readable form for others. Sorry about that. I'm happy to answer any questions. You can contact me at <philzuckerblog@gmail.com> or at `@sandmouth` on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/sandmouth.bsky.social), [Mastodon](https://types.pl/@sandmouth), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sandmouth). My Github is at [https://github.com/philzook58](https://github.com/philzook58).

Also feel welcome to start a discussion <https://github.com/philzook58/philzook58.github.io/discussions> on any questions or comments you might have.

I think my blog is representative of my interests in functional programming, compilers, formal methods, scientific computation, physics, and optimal control. If you are interested in hiring me, please drop me a line on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-zucker-4520ba90/).

An atom feed of the blog is here <https://www.philipzucker.com/feed.xml>

I added a bibtex cite link to my posts. If you read it and it gave you new ideas or helped you understand something, why not cite it? It gives me warm fuzzies. Also, someday I may need a better citation record for something I want, so you're doing me a solid.
