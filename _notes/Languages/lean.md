"The Lean typeclass resolution procedure can be viewed as a
simple Î»-Prolog interpreter [8], where the Horn clauses are the user declared
instances."
That sounds fun

### Build

`elan` tool

`leanpkg`

[`lake`](https://github.com/leanprover/lake) is a new build tool on the horizon. analog of cargo

Using nix is kind of a pain. I haven't done it.


```lean
{% include_relative lean/basics.lean %}
```
