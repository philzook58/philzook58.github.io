    "In LCF style, existential types are a programming language level construct for access control to the innards. Most (all?) mechanisms for access control and trust can be used for building a proof system. Cryptography, permissions, etc. You can have a secret key to sign things that have gone through a trusted verifier. You can merkle tree them. A folder called \"proven\" with write permissions only given to a verifier user also works. A web server with a simple endpoint. Process isolation. These are all mechanisms you can use to build a proof system\n",
