    "\n",
    "\"One potentially helpful way of looking at it: The continuation monad is just a wrapper around (a -> r) -> r) , so Cont r a is essentially just (a -> r) -> r).\n",
    "Because it's a monad, it's a functor. So if you have an \"implication between types\", a -> b, then you've got that implication \"under the continuation monad\", as Cont r a -> Cont r b.  Implications between types capture intuitionistic logic, so the implications \"under the continuation monad\" also captures at least intuitionistic logic.\n",
    "But, because the continuation monad is a monad, you've also got join : Cont r (Cont r a) -> Cont r a . And Cont r a is just a wrapper around (a -> r) -> r, so you can get `join : Cont r ((a -> r) -> r) -> Cont r a , which means that \"under the continuation monad\", (a -> r) -> r implies a. In the special case where r is an uninhabited type, this is double negation elimination, which together with intuitionistic logic, gets you full classical logic. So if P is a classically provable proposition, with the usual connectives, and r is uninhabited, then Cont r P is going to be inhabited.\n",
    "One big challenge though, (which is what the lambda-mu stuff is about) is finding a good term calculus where\n",
    "you can construct terms that inhabit exactly the types corresponding to classically provable propositions (without the Cont r indirection), and\n",

On the other hand, there's the perspective where you're actually kind of jumping around in the term, and doing complicated control flow, and it's hard to intuitively see why that ought to terminate.\n",
    "I'm not sure, but one thing that sort of makes sense to me is that the callcc term (in Pfenning's system) needs to have the data it throws to the continuation as a subterm. So unless it embeds itself as a subterm (so I maybe this is a little question-begging as an explnation if we're asking why it doesn't terminate, since if you're not terminating, maybe you can have a term T that evaluates to something with T as a subterm), it can't \"throw itself\" to the continuation. So the second time the continuation is called (by a throw), it'll have a different, simpler argument than the first time\" - Graham\n",
