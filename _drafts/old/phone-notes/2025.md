Alphaegg

Information flow and the trick
Probablistic parametrcity, probablistic partial evaluation (resampling kind of)? Probablistically apply the trick. You should unroll likely paths and not inroll unlikely
Rename nodes

Differential geometry. What questions and how. Critical pairs and lie brackets? Curvature is non confluence? Vector field is full dynamics or a single rewrite rule? Path are traces.
Types are covering space? simple types make termination possible yo see.

Strata are akin to term orderings / call graphs

Rpython ghidra. Symqemu style constraint iniection?

Pypy for knuckeldragger python verification

History as a fiber. Traces as fibers. Proofs are traces. Hmmm. Fibrations are paths. Path lifting means that the E object is some kind of summary of paths
Diracs belt as a fibration

Finset fibers / dependent functions. Internalization requires being able to make sets of functiosn

Shallow embedding of GAT akin to shallow embedding intuitionisitc.
Kleene equality, not native equality. And kleene should have an ordering higher than wf predicates

Equality clauses as terms. Eq reflection baked in. Global egraph. The hypothetical bank normalizes via ground ordered superpsoition. The Prop sort. eq(a,b) as pulled out of the ether? Bottom up normalization of the proof
Terms as a primitve. Proof terms as a primitive. Bool as constructor theory
Ground superposition as a equational theory of bools analogous to polynomials. Can normalize to inferred implications
A context bank
Datalog as a theory was an approach tried in ASP paper. Hmm. Minimal database that implies something _does_ sound like an asp problem

Full normalize lambda. Open with new cresh primitive not eid. Why bother. Equationg two lambda terms doesn’y go in iegraph. Says they beta unify
LP is ordered rewriting, fourier motKin is knuth bendix
Pinear biund expressions can be normalized.
Really the term bank means everything is guards.
Z3 say all aren’t equal, give back unsat core. Those terms are equal. (?)
A model also helps prune possibilities. If distinct in model, not forced to be equal

Try all insertions for new function symbols? To extend lex orderings
Mutual recursion - set equal in lex ordering, uncomparable, or merge definitions into single body. The ordering of arguments matters. Consider flat lex terms (predicates being rewritten). Tcounter3(4,3,2)
The stack has less bad stuff put on it. Tower of hanoi? Explicit stacks modelling?
A list counter going down

What are the things you’d add to rewriting modulo functional programming. Shortcuts, new domains, identification of constructors?

And = min , or = max
Implies = exists number between input and output? b - a > 0. Total ordering of worlds probably isnt great. Could increase dinensionality? Is this LP? < isn’t great. False = 0? Neginf?
Lex open.
Extdned reals are topologically the closed interval.
Fibration maps to indexing space.

Metatheory is a formalization of “background”. How does one increase your background? Examples? Synthesis, abduction, inductive leaps?
Examples are models in very weak metatheories just as much as they are themselves modles in the larger thing
Fibred teleacope manifolds will have triangular differentials. Lagrange multipliers when hit edge? Equations of motion for sphere projected onto disk. Looks like bouncing. Same idea as flipped dynamic represneting bouncing. Topological pasting diagrams

Smt solvers themselves present the interface of a theory. No canon though
Multisorted theories and multitheory sorts
While many egraphs have a giant union find, they can be indexed by sort since two non equal sorts will never be identifie
Iso gluing of two constructor thoeries. Hmm. Maybe theory union needs to take in isomorphisms of thoeries? Ahead of timefixing how cross theories relate. Disjoint in some parts but glued by isomorphism in other like chart maps. Constructors + unitnerp constants les complicated than full egraph. This is the prolog theory

What if I ground check according to all orderings of variables. That lifts any ground ordering to a variable term ordering?
Differential enodes. Keep vector of d/dx in there? Differential ring as eclass ids? Differential ring va just differential. Yea, it trally might be nice to attach to enode. Replace cos everywhree with dsin. Dexp= exp. Maybe both. Use diff ring eid and in enode. But then a symmettry. Hmm

Midpoint algebra
Derivations

The orient move leaves behind an equation of the derivative
Overlap can include dervatives? Anti derivatives?

I need to start talking about core
Should I really be celebrating corey bringing him happiness and contentment. Finding the perfect equal of his idiocy?
When I see him look into her eyes with unparalleled levels of adoration, it causes me physical pain, because I inversely linked our fortunes in an unholy basement rite.
When she tags festoons him with doodads like rings and braelets and temporary tattoos, where will I place my ribbons and horse tags?
I wake up in dread
I dread the day when
I fear corey will so fully festoons will with rings and other marking baubles that there won’t be an inch left for my cattle tags and brandings
Im supposed to be celebratong this? How happy he makes her and she makes him?

Will horseshoe crab rotting
Will is a good sport. There were _years_ we were trying to put money in his sleeping mouth for pictures to makea fraudelent enterprise in his name. But, I assume he has forgiven us. I know that sounds bad, but I think this is before they had rules about that

Be angry about his good qualities

Will has an annatural appreciation for life, sensation, the little things

Uuuuugreegg WILL YOU MAKE ME SO MAD. WHY I OUGHTA
(Clearly read off of notes following with finger)

Will is an aesthete.

But tactfully edearing friend. Tastefully endearing

Will, corey, the greatest truth or “splim” of all is that I love you, and I’m confident in the happiness of your lives together

Nay, the concept of concepts
For what IS a concept except a fact deprived of its realoty. Concretality
But I digress

I remember a dejected will on a porch, deeply and earnestly wishing to find his other half. In the true depths of despair. It was great. Until a few months later _corey_ had to come along and fulfill his dreams a _lesson_ that in what can feel like our darkest times, we may be only onths away from the the best thing to ever happen to us. I can never forgive her
