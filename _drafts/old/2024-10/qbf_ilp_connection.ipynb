    "To show that the RHS is satisfiable, we need an assignment to propositional variables that witnesses its satisfiability. We can get this by taking the assignment  that makes a subscripted variable aᵢ true just in case a is true at xᵢ. This clearly takes care of the first two conjuncts. For the universal conjunct, because of the antecedent restricting the possible values of p₃, we just need to verify that this makes (a) ∃s₃₊₄, s₁=p₁ ∧ s₃₊₁ and (b) ∃s₃₊₁, s₂=p₂ ∧ s₃₊₁ true. We can do that by letting s₁₊₁ witness for s₃₊₄ in (a), and letting s₂₊₄ witness for s₃₊₄ in (b). Vice versa (constructing a frame from a satisfying assignment to the formula) is similar, introducing one point in the frame for each subscript made entirely of diamond-indicies, and reading accessibility relations off of the prefix-of relation on the subscripts.

    "This article describes an evaluation of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) systems on problems taken from the QMLTP library of first-order modal logic problems. Principally, the problems are translated to both typed first-order and higher-order logic in the TPTP language using an embedding approach, and solved using first-order resp. higher-order logic ATP systems and model finders. Additionally, the results from native modal logic ATP systems are considered, and compared with the results from the embedding approach. The findings are that the embedding process is reliable and successful when state-of-the-art ATP systems are used as backend reasoners, The first-order and higher-order embeddings… Show more"
