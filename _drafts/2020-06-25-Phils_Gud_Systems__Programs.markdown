Sometimes I have no idea what to do with a new programming language or new ideas. Here is a brainstorm list of stuff too do.







## Phil's gud systems







Good systems for simulation and control and verification







  * 1-D Linear - Heating
  * 2-D linear. SHO. damped undamped Sliding block/free particle.
  * 4-D linear 2-SHO
  * ManyD linear - SHO chains, circuits, elastic fields
  * Pendulum
  * Double Pendulum
  * Cart pole
  * Acrobot
  * Quadrotor
  * 2D Arm planning
  * Puck World
  * Car Steering
  * Bouncing Ball - Collisional
  * Wall SHO
  * 





### Phil's gud programs







Interetsing programs to write in any language. 







  * Any of the above
  * Ray trace
  * lambda calc intepreter
  * particles
  * fractals
  * Kx = b
  * Fluid
  * Video games
  * Project euler






### Phil's Gud verification / Proofs







  * Fibonacci
  * List Functions
  * Nats - commutative associative
  * Z 
  * Rationals
  * Lambda calc I guess
  * cosine / sine / exp
  * Topology
  * Sorting, sort tup
  * Floating Point / Fixed Point rounding
  * Simplex / LP
  * Gaussian Elim
  * Dynamic Programming, rod cutting
