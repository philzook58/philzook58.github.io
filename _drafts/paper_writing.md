title: My Confused Emotions about Papers

I kind of don't read papers

Why benchmarks?

Why write?

Proof of work. 95% of ideas are flawed. Careful consideration under a task is important

Books are hard because you can skim. Video or lecturing is nice because it forces you to slow down

Will AI slop change the dynamic enough? AI is not crisp. Talking to a person with a crisp understand will imprint upon you good ways of thinking. Talking to a person with muddled understanding will leave you also muddled.
Crisp usage of terminology. Careful connotative choice of words. The meta vs object distinction.
I have the image or feeling of an equation or derivation or code  when I am saying something crisp.
