Nice picture of eggy omelet?

# Overview

- Bottom-up E-matching
  - Terms Modulo Theories
  - Patterns
- Semantic E-ids
  - E-graphs are models
  - UF is canonizer for atomic equations
  - Linear expressions, polynomials, multisets also have canonizers
  - Undecidable canonizers

# Motivation: AC Sucks

# Tease Apart the Roles

E-graphs are:

- Term banks `add_term : t -> term -> unit`
- Term finders `match : t -> pat -> subst list`
- Equality stores `assert_eq : t -> term -> term -> unit`

<!--
Put in term bank here
-->

<!--  
- `E.union(t,t)`

- Term finders `match : t -> pat -> subst list`
- Equality checkers `is_eq : t -> term -> term -> bool`
- Canonizers `t -> term -> term`

The first half of the talk is the role as a term bank
the second half is as its role as an equality store

These are allow intertwicned
A good method is to simplify a problem unitl its basically trivial and then add back in the ocmplexity.

Theory -> E-TermBank 
The unionfind tikes the knot back to the theory
Teasing apart these different roles.

<!-- Breadth first -->

# Naive Equational Search

- Hash Cons a term bank
- Rewrite over it
- Mark discovered equalities as edges.
- Egraphs as term banks
  - c

---

# E-graphs and Term Banks

- E-graphs are both term banks and equality stores

- c = c

-->

<!-- Term Banks Modulo Theories -->
<!-- Hash consing modulo theories -->
---

# Term Banks Modulo Theories

- Rigid baked in "nice" theories.
- Interning by structural normalization
  - Smart constructors <!-- apply convergent rewrites to normal forms -->

    - Ex: $x + 0 \rightarrow x$

    ```python
    def add(x,y):
      return x if y == 0 else hashcons(("+", x, y))
    ```

<!--
  - Children collections (set, multiset, polynomials, etc)

      ```python
      def add(*args):
        return ("+", multiset(args))
      ```

  ```python
  add_term((x + 0) + y + 0)
  add_term(y + 0)
  add_term((x + 0) + 0)
  ```

  ![](./xy.svg)

-->

<!--
Too condensed.
An example. Show 

add_term(add((x,add(0,0)))
add_term(add(x,0))

-->

<!-- 

- Hash consing mod theories via structural normalization

What was so frut6rating about AC? Flatteining and sorting

-->

<!-- Show rules. x + 0 -> x -->
<!-- show smart constructor

def add(x,y):
  return x if y == 0 else ("+", x, y)
- Hash Consing Modulo Theories
  - Canonize
  - Homomoprhic Hashes

```ocaml
type term = {head : str; children: children}
and children =
  | Ordered of term list
  | MS of term multiset
```

# Term Banks Modulo Theories

|   |   |
|---|---|
| `add_term : t -> term -> unit` |  ‚úÖ |
| `match : t -> pat -> subst list` | ‚ùì |
| `assert_eq : t -> term -> term -> unit` | ‚ùì |

<!-- 
| `is_eq : t -> term -> term -> bool` | ‚úÖ | `is` |
| `canon : t -> term -> term` |  ‚úÖ  | `id` |

Assert_eq can be dealt with via a brute force table.
Maybe not an X so much as a so-so

Is the second half of the talk necessary?
You can kind of take terms modulo theories and toss on a union find?
Uhhhh. Maybe (?). No.

Can I add ground rules to a convergent rewrite system and always make it work?
No. String rewriting counterexampel. Really?
Well you can keep normalizing terminating.
But not confluent.

# Pattern Matching

- Implicit terms
  - Consider pattern `?x + 0`

<!-- 
- E-matching
  - Top Down
  - Bottom Up
-->

  ```python
  add_term((x + 0) + y)
  ```

  ![](./xy.svg)

<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_number This also what people mean by using AC for addition.
AC1 is multiset matching. Both are really.
Maybe the second is ACI?

# Top Down E-matching

- Scan termbank for term roots
- #substitutions depends on theory
  - Factor $F$ at each theory node of pattern

|  Theory  |  Pattern   |  Theory Factor $F$  |
|-------------|------------|--------|
|    ADT      |    $cons(X,Y) =^? cons(1, nil)$     |   1   |  
|  E-Graph  |   $foo(X,Y) \in^? \{foo(e_1,e_2), bar(e_2) \}$         |   $\|eclass\|$ |
|      MultiSet 1     |  $[X,Y,Z] =^? [1,2,3]$ | (\#Vars)!  |  
|      MultiSet 2     |  $X + Y =^? [1,2,3]$  | #Partitions |
|    Linear   | $X + Y =^? 42$  |  $\infty$  |

<!-- `match : t -> pat -> subst list` -->
<!-- + 0 |    X + 0 = y  |  1  -->
---

# KEY IDEA: Bottom Up E-matching

- E-match _over the term bank_, not on term
  - `match : term -> pat -> subst list`
  - `match : termbank -> pat -> subst list`
- Bind variables by traversing term bank
  - Ex: $foo(bar(X), Y) \rightarrow biz(X)$
- Optimizations

```python
for X in terms:
  for Y in terms:
    lhs = foo[bar[X], Y]
    if lhs in terms:
      rhs = biz(X)
      add_equality(lhs, rhs)
```

<!--
Why is this not intuitive.
We have this single term mindset. 
You can convert pattern matching 

Vectorized versions of stuff

-->
---

# Bottom Up E-matching Plays Nicer with Theories

<!-- - Theory Factor $F = \frac{N}{E}$, Pattern depth $d$ -->
<!--
- Top down $O(T F^d )$.
  - Deep is bad. Ex: $foo(foo(foo(foo(X))))$
- Bottom up $O(T^V d \ln(T))$

- Many var is bad. Ex: $foo(X,Y,Z,W,V,U)$
-->
  <!-- - No $F$ dependence -->
|   |     TD  |      BU |
|---|-----|-------------|
| Cost  |  $O(T F^d )$  |  $O(T^V d \ln(T))$  |
| $foo(foo(foo(foo(X))))$  | üò¢   |    üòÄ |
| $foo(X,Y,Z,W,V,U)$ |      üòÄ   |  üò¢  |
<!--
- Why?
  - Grounds fast
-->
- Pareto frontier for simplicity-power
  - Grounds fast
  - Only needs canonizer, not expander / unapply
<!-- 

Completness.

-->

<!--
Give conrete data for
((x + y) + z) pattern?

Shallow many vars

- Benefits of Theories & simplicity vs Flexibility and optimiality?
  - I dunno
- E-Graphs have Term Banks
- Generate terms, prune, discover equalities
-->

<!--

## Demo

```python
    def ematch(self, vs: list[smt.ExprRef], pat: smt.ExprRef) -> list[list[smt.ExprRef]]:
        res = []
        for eids in itertools.product(*[self.roots[v.sort()] for v in vs]):
            ts = [self.terms[eid] for eid in eids]
            lhs = smt.substitute(pat, *zip(vs, ts))
            if self.in_terms(lhs):
                res.append(ts)
        return res
```

### Brute Force SMT E-Graph

# Tying the Knot

|   |   |
|---|---|
| `add_term : t -> term -> unit` |  ‚úÖ |
| `match : t -> pat -> subst list` | ‚úÖ |
| `assert_eq : t -> term -> term -> unit` | ‚ùì |

<!-- 
| `is_eq : t -> term -> term -> bool` | ‚úÖ|
| `canon : t -> term -> term` |  ‚úÖ |

assert_eq in the e-graph is supplied by the union find?

- So far a fixed background "good" notion of equality
- E-graphs assert pieces pulled from of "bad" notions of equality

# E-Graphs are Models

- Funnels from syntax to semantics

## Union finds

- Canonizers ground atomic equations
- What interface really matters?
- Shostak theories

---

# E-graphs are Models
<!-- What are E-graphs? 

- E-graphs are models of a partial logic
- $\downarrow t$ and  $t_1 = t_2$
- SMT models (show z3)
  - Free Logic
  - Generalized Algebraic Theories
  - Essential Algebraic Theories
  - Partial Horn Logic

# Q: What is this the interface to?

```ocaml
type uf
type id
val create : unit ‚àí> 
val eq : uf ‚àí> id ‚àí> id ‚àí> bool
val fresh : uf ‚àí> id
val canon : uf ‚àí> id ‚àí> eid
val assert_eq : uf ‚àí> id ‚àí> id ‚àí> unit
```
-->

---

# Q: What does the Union Find do?

```ocaml
type t
type id
val is_eq : t ‚àí> id ‚àí> id ‚àí> bool
val fresh : t ‚àí> id
val canon : t ‚àí> id ‚àí> id
val assert_eq : t ‚àí> id ‚àí> id ‚àí> unit
```

- But not only a union find presents this interface!

<!-- 
create

val rebuild 

The union find? Yes. also the egraph itself 

SMT solvers and their theories present the same interface.
If you don't use SAT, SMT is its theory.

Egraphs and union finds also present the same interface.

type key
interpret : t -> key -> eid   union find dict
explain
lookup : t -> eid -> key (extract)

-->

<!--
---

# Union Find Replacements

```ocaml

type t = uf
type id = int

type t = egraph 
type id = eid

type t = row_echelon
type id = int lin_expr

...
```
-->

<!--
type t = uf_unify
type id = Eid of int | PrimInt int | Fn of string * id list 

type t = grobner
type id = int poly

type t = knuth_bendix
type id = Eid of int | Var of int | Fn of string * eid list 

-->

---

# KEY IDEA: Structured E-ids
<!--
The internals of the union find don't matter. 
-->

<!-- e-ids as values -->
- Alternative names: Semantic e-ids, _Values_
- _E-graphs are Models_ (for a partial logic)
  - $\downarrow t$ and  $t_1 = t_2$
- Replace union find with theory specific _extensible_ canonizers
  - Rebuild has the flavor of _ground_ Knuth Bendix completion
  - Stock UF is uninterpreted values $e_i$ and atomic equations $e_i = e_j$
- Merges the concepts of containers, primitives, and e-ids
- E-nodes are interned, seids are ephemeral
