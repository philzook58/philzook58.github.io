# E-graphs Modulo Theories

I gave a talk on Egraphs modulo theories in Korea. Super fun trip. It was a big push to get something coherent together enough to present. Really the basic idea I talked about was the same as that from the 2024 blog posts.

# Knuckledragger

I worked more on Knuckledragger

I presented Knuckledragger at NEPLS

A theme of just doing things on the z3 AST. I think this was kind of my super power and let things build on top of each other.

I did make progress this year, but a little bit felt like I was standing still. Did I do anythig really new for myself?

I yearn for new things, but I also have and do many of the things I do because I like and wanted them. I don't have good flywheels going for this stuff. I'm obsessed with equations, maybe because I receive positive external feedback from that.

- Computer graphics
- More with my hands. Circuits
- Physics

I will probably have the same list next year.

Ben's son was born this year, that's been a big change.

Did the minikanren committee. <https://www.philipzucker.com/compose_datalog/> was to try and make something for minikanren, since I had such a ball in Korea I wanted to do ICFP too, but it's a lot for one year.

Been trying yoga lately since I moved next to a studio. I'm hoping that sticks. I think an hour every couple of days is really good for me. Yoga people do often seem like they're in amazing shape.
