# E-graphs Modulo Theories

I gave a talk on Egraphs modulo theories in Korea. Super fun trip. It was a big push to get something coherent together enough to present. Really the basic idea I talked about was the same as that from the 2024 blog posts.

# Knuckledragger

I worked more on Knuckledragger <www.kdrag.com>

I presented Knuckledragger at NEPLS which was good.

A theme of just doing things on the z3 AST. I think this was kind of my super power and let things build on top of each other.

I was disappointed that it seems like no one is interested in using the system. But maybe that is for the best. I should make more decisions to be what I want rather than what I think someone else may want. I should go about building things in a way that they can but it's ok if no one ever uses.

Basically all are variations on trying to take seriously in mundane ways types = sets. Families of sets are as commonplace as nested loops

I never got the version about higher order contracts out there. All this really started with some ill formed goal of using sympy to describe for actual geometrical fibers. Learned a lot. Maybe should revisit that.

We were also reading Rijke's Homotopy Type Theory textbook, which kept inciting questions.

# House Fire

This was crazy. I think the knock on effects of all the stress were kind of alarming on my memory and brain function. Seems to be getting better now.

# Things To Write About Next Year

- Algebra of assembly
- SMTCC
- ARIP
- Dynamic Datalog Stratification. Idea: Select a term ordering. Maintain a frontier of facts we know we won't derive anything underneath. Only actually use negation if it is below frontier in term order. If we derive nothing new in an iteration, push the frontier forward to weakest negative facts. Prolog with term ordering. Use this to select goal to resolve out of goal stack.
- ggkb. generalized ground knuth bendix
- slotted egraphs and epr. Weakly ground terms have variables but no interesting overlaps with those variables. KB still finishes. `X != Y` constraints makes into slots
- Tensor Grobner Bases
- Semiring Grobner Bases for Seven Trees in One
- Simplex, fourier motzkin and assymettric completion. z^2 = ax as representing inequalities and use grobner? z^4 = z^2
- Unification vs Knuth Bendix as duals but also perhaps somewhat embeddable. The rewrite system returned can be considered as a substitution.
- Inductionless induction / proof by consistency. Actually saturate a completion algorithm. Shows false is not derivable.
- SES stochastic equational search. Why not more of this?
- Atomic Type Theory - What does type theory look like if there are no compound symbols? What is an abstract bool?
- Step Indexed Logical relations. stratify the values by observation time rather than creation time. Then it is finite enough to do in python sets. The 0th level of regular step indexing has all stuck values.
- Incremental automata minimization - If you label some states as not observed or have a order describing degree of observation, you can still glue automata together at those edges, while minimizing / compacting the "inner states". Hash consing is incremental minimization of algebraic expressions.
- Chebyshev coefficients (or other coefficients) as codes (like godel coding). Converting higher order into first order data
- Picking bidrectional synth/check as a constraint optimization problem. Pfenning heuristic is a decision heuristic
- Z3 minikanren esimp style.
- Arbitrary length bitvectors. `Seq(BV1)` seems fine?

## Knuckledragger

- Push harder on concrete analysis problems (fuck filters)
- Hyperreals
- Verilog. Yosys ingest or pretty print out
- CF abstract domain of known bits. Show is galois (best abstraction)
- Chill out my dude

I did make progress this year, but a little bit felt like I was standing still. Did I do anythig really new for myself?

I yearn for new things, but I also have and do many of the things I do because I like and wanted them. I don't have good flywheels going for this stuff. I'm obsessed with equations, maybe because I receive positive external feedback from that.

- Computer graphics
- More with my hands. Circuits
- Physics

I will probably have the same list next year.

Ben's son was born this year, that's been a big change.

Did the minikanren committee. <https://www.philipzucker.com/compose_datalog/> was to try and make something for minikanren, since I had such a ball in Korea I wanted to do ICFP too, but it's a lot for one year.

Been trying yoga lately since I moved next to a studio. I'm hoping that sticks. I think an hour every couple of days is really good for me. Yoga people do often seem like they're in amazing shape.
