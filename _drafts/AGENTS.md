This is my personal blog.
I want to keep things very personal.
Edit very minimally. Only do what I ask you to.
I usually want hacky little snippets, not industrialized stuff.
I don't want you to write anything. I like writing in my own voice and style.
Searching through things I have previously written is very useful to me.
I often have links or little ideas in here.
