I noticed as I was reviewing last year that today is the 10 year anniversay of my blog. WOO! ðŸŽ‰

My first post was stunning <https://www.philipzucker.com/getting-wordpress-to-work/> to say the least.

# Blogging Techniques and Thoughts

I think generally people are too secretive about their work. It's insane to me the number of github projects that are in private mode that will never be comfortable go public, even if they do have some MVP that's kind of interesting.

A. no one cares  B. if they could care, say it often and early so someone could hear it.

This is partly again my personality. I can sprint a bit, but long hauls with no external validation are hard/impossible. If you really can work on something for 5 years and then put it out, more power to you.

If you are starting a blog, unless you are already famous somehow, you do not have an audience. Even if you put out world shaking shit, no one will read it. So don't worry about it. Just put stuff out. You need surface area for anyone to find you.

The thing academics get the most famous for is writing an undergrad textbook. Jealous people who haven't written a popular undergrad textbook will pooh-pooh this. You may also get a couple theorems or experiments named after you.

## How I write notes

# 2015-2016

It was originally a wordpress instance that I put on nearlyfreespeech, a cheap hosting service. It's too bad but I don't remember the initial impetus for making it. It slowly rotted over the next couple years until I migrated it to Jekyll and github pages in 2020 <https://www.philipzucker.com/i-moved-my-blog-from-wordpress/>. I actually had tried out Jekyll

I was in grad school for physics at the time, a decade younger. In the process of realizing I wasn't going to make it big there, despite the greatest efforts I knew how to give.

In the olden times, I thought it was a useful endeavor to explain how to install software, which is often a challenge. I think at some point I got good enough at guessing how to fix broken builds that it didn't seem worth making a whole post on anymore.

This also shows from the beginning that I felt that there was no scope too small to be worth a post. Keeping flow is important.

By 2018 or 2019 the scope of my posts started turning more expansive.

There is something intrinsically compelling about physics.

Some of this comes from our culture's respect and honor for it, and most of us crave respect and honor. And some of that respect comes from the difficulty of it, some comes from the atomic bomb, a rare case of an academic discipline completely reorganizing global politics.
