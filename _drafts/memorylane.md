Reading Bohm Blackboady derivation on patio outside freshman can building dorms. Arguing wiht austin about vectors

Summer, I was reading that mathematical physics book on the back patio. sines and cosines as a vector space. Good stuff. dual vector basis.

Circuits courses
game theory
materials
principles of modern physics
Boolean course
differential equations
Intro to matrices
energetics
mechanics. Ohhh. Yeah. It used that Marlon book. I had already done susskind so was well prepped. I think it was poorly taught otherwise
intro to quantum by good educator
intro the differential geometry
Complex analysis engineering

Sitting on on that graduate topology course, methamacital finanace?, PDEs. Way outside my abilities

Getting pancakes with my Labmate in circuits. He liked guns

Bewildering thermodynamics courses. eutectics. Gibbs duhem.
That professor freaking out at us. Embarassing for all.

Engineering electro. Exam question was wrong. Stuck to my guns.
Waveguides. I had a whole thing about waveguides and reflecting / method of images

Getting that problem wrong in grffiths EM confiednetly, then eating my words. It was about a changing permittivity surface I think?

The "renormalization" method of dealing with the wiggling stick / rods

Trying to understand the addition of spins in a visual way. Spins were like adding cones.

Optical theorem
