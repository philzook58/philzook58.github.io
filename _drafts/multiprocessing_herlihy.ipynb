The distinction between internal states and observations is a common on in kalman filters for example. Invariants (energy, momentum) are a nice method to say something about a dynamical system. Termination measures and lyapunov functions are pretty similar things. know lamport took cues from physics for the clock ideas and a focus on invariants. Something about prophecy variables reminds me of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_function#Advanced_and_retarded_Green's_functions a non intuitive variety of green's function for which the influence propagates backwards in time. The more intuitive thing to propagate backwards is kalman filter like stuff, where you use future observations to infer a past state rather than integrate applied forces/control inputs to propagate states forward, but I think it's similar math.\n",

    "A system's behavior is a sequence of states\n",
    "Not all states are always visible; states can be internal. So a behavior is really a sequence of pairs of states, a visible state and an internal state.\n",
    "A specification should describe only visible state.\n",
    "A specification should not distinguish between behaviors that differ only with respect to internal states.\n",
    "A change solely in in internal state causes a \"stutter\" in the behavior that results from attending to only the visible states; a stutter is a repetition of a visible state.\n",
    "Let Γs be the set of behaviors that are like s, differing only with respect to stuttering - adding and deleting finite runs of repeated state.\n",
    "A specification that permits s should permit anything in Γs.[^1]\n",
    "A low level specification L implements another higher level specification H if they're talking about the same kind of visible state (but maybe specify systems with different internal state. E.g. a algorithm that involves an internal counter vs a hardware implementation of that algorithm), and for every sequence\n",
    "(v₁,i₁), (v₂,i₂), …\n",
    "that L allows, there's a corresponding behavior\n",
    "(v₁,i'₁), (v₂,i'₂), …\n",
    "with the same visible behavior (up to stuttering), allowed by H. (so if you throw away the internal state on both sides, then closing the behaviors allowed by H under stuttering will include all the behaviors allowed by L). One nice way to prove implementation is to find a refinement mapping f such that if\n",
    "(v₁,i₁), (v₂,i₂), …\n",
    "is allowed by L, then\n",
    "f(v₁,i₁), f(v₂,i₂), …\n",
    "is allowed by H. Even if L implements H though, the existence of a mapping like this isn't guaranteed.\n",
    "A refinement mapping might not exist, first of all, because the internal state of H might be more fine-grained than L in a way that it unrecoverable from the state of L. For example, if the visible state is the low order bit, and H is a three bit clock, then H could be implemented by an L with no internal state, and just alternating 1,0 for visible state.\n",
    "The fix for this sort of situation is to add history variables to L, which basically record what's already happened to L, but don't interact otherwise, so in the case above, you might add a counter n to L's state so that when you need to map an L state to an H state, you can read the value of H's counter off of L's history variable.\n",
    "You might also have non-determinism that happens at different times, leading to a different kind of non-recoverability. For example, L might pick a random number at each tick of the clock, throwing the first away and displaying the rest, while H might pick one, and display the pick on the next round. So L's behaviors would be like:\n",
    "    (•,()), (1,()), (50,()), (42,()) …\n",
    "and H's would be like:\n",
    "    (•,1), (1,50), (50,42), (42,75) …\n",
    "In this case, you can't produce a refinement map to recover a corresponding state of H from a state of L, even though they both implement each other. And you can't figure out that the last state in the sequence should be (42,75), no matter how much additional historical information you pack into (42,()). In this case you need to enrich the behaviors of L with prophecy variables. A prophecy variable decides, in advance, what non-deterministic choices L is going to make. In the example above, H is just L plus a prophecy variable.\n",
    "There's also an extra move where you pack extra stuttering into prophecy variable changes, by not just adding them alongside the existing behaviors of L but by getting the behaviors of the new system by also replacing individual states of L with runs of state in which the L part doesn't change but the prophecy variable bounces around. So prophecy variables can be abused to take care of the scenario where H \"runs slower\" than L, for example if the visible state is the hour hand of a clock, and H includes minute and second hands, while L includes just the minute hand.\n",
    "If you define everything *way* more precisely, then the big theorem is, I think, that, subject to reasonable constraints on H, L, if L implements H, then there's an L' obtained from L by adding a prophecy and a history variable such that there's a refinement mapping from L' to H.\n",
    "[^1]: Such a specification will always be the conjunction of a safety and a liveness property!\n",
    "If you think of the sequences as topologized like Baire space, where basic clopens are Sᵨ where ρ is a finite sequence, then  a safety property is a closed set, since its complement is defined to be sequences that have certain initial segments, and a liveness property is a dense set, since a liveness property can always happen, so no matter what prefix you chose, some element of the liveness property lives in the corresponding basic open. So actually any set S of behaviors at all is the conjunction of a safety and a liveness property: take the topological closure C of S. The consider the union U of S and the complement of C. I claim U is dense: consider any nonempty open set O. If O does not intersect S, then O's complement contains S, and is closed, and therefore contains C. But then O lies in (and intersects) the complement of C. However U intersect C = S, so S is the intersection of a closed and a dense set"
