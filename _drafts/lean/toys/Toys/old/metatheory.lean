A key piece of describing mathematical logic is the distinction between the object logic and the metalogic. This distinction is hard to keep clear in english sentences.
I don't know the good way to make the leap of understanding. I think I have the spark of it, but not a full grokking.

How does baby come to some understanding of words?
How does a gradeschooler come to understand a "variable" or "polynomial". It's a gradual soak

We can convert meta nat to object nat, but meta plus can't really be "seen" in the same way. And how much of this is special to how lean works.

Instead we need to define a notion of programs

They could be turing machines.
They could

run : program -> evidence -> bool

Enumerable sets. What does that mean? We need a particular language we're wroking in
Computable functions. What does that mean?
If we have an signature extension, then there is a natrual notion of comparing theories,
but otherwise we really need to define what it means to compare two systems

Systems are already comparable in that they live in the same metalogic (lean)

And they can be compared via the lean intermediary if you've given them semantics in lean

If you bottow your host powers, you kind of don't know what you're borrowing
That's the beauty and danger of it
