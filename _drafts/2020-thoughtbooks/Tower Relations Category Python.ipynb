    "\n",
    "Category theory is a mathematical theory with reputation for being very abstract.\n",
    "Category theory is an algebraic theory of functions. It has the flavor of connecting up little pipes and ports that is reminiscent of dataflow languages or circuits, but with some hearty mathematical underpinnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a really delightful book by Rydeheard and Burstall called Computational Category Theory. The first time I looked at it, I couldn't make heads or tails of it, going on the double uphill battle of category theory and Standard ML. But looking at it now, it seems extremely straightforward and well presented. It's a cookbook of how to build category theoretic interfaces for software.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it is easy to have the miscomprehension that a fancy language like Haskell or Agda is necessary to even begin writing software that encapsulates category theory based ideas, but this is simply not the case. I've been under this misapprehension before.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I think it is interesting to perform some translation into python, the lingua franca of computing today.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple category is that of finite sets. The objects in the category can be represented by python sets. The morphisms can be represented by python dictionaries. Nothing abstract here. We can rip and tear these things apart any which way we please.\n",
    "\n",
    "The manipulations are made even more pleasant by the python features of set and dictionary comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a python class for FinSet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next time:\n",

    "Category theory can get quite high falutin'. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a programming perspective what is the point of all this goddamn nonsense?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Good libraries present an interface to the users. One of the measures of the goodness or badness of an interface is how often you are inclined to peek under the hood to get it to do the thing that you need.\n",
    "I think to some degree that catgeory theorists want to replace underlying mathematical constructions with a uniform categerical interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "They abhor piercing the abstraction barrier so much so that they want to replace any underlying mechanisms with a synthetic version.\n",
    "The formalization and synethetication of math goes all the way back. It has been said that in Euclid's elements, the diagrams are actually just commentary. The arguments in the text should follow given a completely abstract notion of what a point and line actually are. Another exmaple is the square root of two. Most of us have a conception that the square root of 2 is 1.41yada and we can point to it's location on the number line. However, there is a more formal algebraic perspective that the square root of two is some abstract symbol that can be replaced with 2 whenever it appears squared. There is actually a great deal of utility to this persepctive, for example it is the very very start of even framing what it means for a polynomial equation to be solvable in closed form by radicals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Category theory has been found to be a powerful organizing principle of very disparate fields of mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've become used to associating category theory with Haskell and Agda and Coq and Scala and other very complicated powerfully typed languages. But that is not at all a necessity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I find it very helpful to think about how to meaningfully represent these high falutin' things in python. Python is the lingua franca of programming languages these days. It's pretty easy to learn and get started in all things consider. The library ecosystem is nuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can say that such and such construction exists in this category, but I am very confused unless I can understand how such a thing can be represented and actually calculated. The universal constructions like equalizers and pullbacks require a not impossible, but also not trivial amount of work to actually compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "FinSet is a very nice category to get started in. \n",
    "The first example of a category in a programming context is often the functions of the language itself. This is great because they are very familiar and useful. It's not great because functions are not easily introspectable or analyzable, making some important categorical constructions basically impossible to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions from finite domains to finite codomians can be tabulated into the friendly and familiar python dictionary though! We can run those bad boy backwards and forwards, no problem. Slice 'em, dice 'em , fry 'em. In addition we have the love dictionary comprehension syntax, which makes the definitions appear very close to mathematical definitions you'll find on wikipedia.\n",
