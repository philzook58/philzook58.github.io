    "There are some doges for this problem. If R is for serious a particular finite relation, I can precompute the transitive clousure and just write that to constraint Rstar.

It is not however, instead collapsing into a single object in the model `[a = V1, b = V1, c = V1, d = V1, e = V1]` is valid.\n",
