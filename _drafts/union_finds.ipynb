    "- I think the different styles of implementing union find via refcells vs arenas vs dictionaries is interesting. I feel like many things I see focus on the refcell version whereas I almost exclusively use the arena / dictionary version.\n",
    "- The proof producing union find is interesting. If a union find is for quickly checking connected components in a graph, the proof producing union find retains enough to give a spanning tree of those component\n",
    "- We were discussing earlier that you can have information keyed on equivalence classes that has a merge (add, min, max, others) function to call when two classes merge. Now that CF mentions it, this is evocative of attributed variables https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/attributedvariables  (which is what you were referring to?)\n",
    "- I believe it's possible to have a hierarchy of union finds where ufs lower in the hierarchy inherit unions from higher in the hierarchy. I think this is what this paper is getting at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19203 but I'm interpolating a lot there. I have some speculation this might be a way to look at levels as they appear in HM inference. When you enter a let binding, allocate a new UF that inherits from above but doesn't effect the UFs above. When you leave the let, scan and destroy this new UF to know what to generalize. Again, highly speculative\n",
    " You can annotate a union find with things that aren't equal also https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3704913 in \"forbid lists\". Merged classes accumulate forbid lists, so it's similar to the annotated information idea0 \n",

    "   https://z3prover.github.io/papers/z3internals.html#sec-equality-and-uninterpreted-functions This also describes a method of splicing in a linked list to enumerate equivalence classes. I like Harold's description better. Chris' aegraph has union nodes for a related purpose. I think of those as storing \"right side up\" the tree that the union find is the upside down version of.Philip Zucker: I sometimes muse about tie breaking unions not on rank or whatever but by other criteria. Again, in the aegraph I believe it used a deterministic method (oldest or newest?). It is also interesting to force union(x,y) to make y the parent and x the child always. This gives programmer control which is kind of interesting.\n",
    "Maybe firing on false beauty, but there's something intriguing that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_refinement is dual to union finds in some sense. Union finds start all disjoint by assumption and merges. Partition refinement starts all merged by assumption and splits. This has never ended up being a useful observation to me. \n",
    "- Here's another one. I'm contrary, so I often just don't path compress or instead I do full eager compression of union finds in a \"rebuild\" pass, in both cases completely ruining the ackermann whatever. If you combine eager compression with a deterministic parent tie breaking (min for example), you can put a union find into a canonical form and then hash cons it for first class union finds.\n",
