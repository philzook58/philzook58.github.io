## Automated Reasoning for Compilers

Simplification mode vs proving mode

## Bitter Pills

Hmm. This compiler pessimism is not universal.

Proebsting's Law: Compiler Advances Double Computing Power Every 18 Years

<https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1515> Compiler Optimizations are Awesome <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14453962>

- LLVM and GCC are insane

- Flexibility
- Simplicity. How many man years
- Declarativeness and trustworthiness
- enable Higher level abstractions at low cost

Parallelism. All your FLOPS are in your tensor processing units.

## Greedy Simplification

## Egraphs

Compelling from a data structure perspective

Shallow sharing is easy.
Deep sharing

## Egglog

Program analysis and datalog
What is datalog
Program analsyis
Fixed points
graphs

Why was I initially interested

## What are compilers

general purpose IRs

cranelift - gvn

pegs

IR types: rvsdg, ssa cfg

speciality IRs
diospyros
genslide

# Tensors

# What am I excited about

Egraphs modulo theories
Knuth bendix for compilers

# Your compiler already has an egraph in it

Global Value Numbering

# Instruction Selection and Extraction

# Compiling with Constraints

# Bits and Bobbles

If I have 10 days to get numbers to prove my points, what would I do?
