Started my journey!
Was tinkering on my slides Tuesday and they locked into a workable form.
Plane was not nearly as horrible as I worried. Stood up every once in a while
Announced my coming on the various social media. Good technique. I have a hard time butting into conversations but like when people start one with me.

Algebraic Subtyping and biunification. Very long and full of protens

# 12

Big day of walking! Started up to the seoul tower. Very uphill.

I feel like I barely ate all day by accident. It was hard to pick a place.
I've also been a bit uncertain on whether card will be accepted?

I got ginseng chicken soup at this place. I keep getting drawn to lines.

# 13

Started day a little late. Practicing slides. Exhausted from yesterday. I keep crashing at 7pm and waking up at 2pm. I guess that works.

Bukchon Hanok village <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukchon_Hanok_Village>

Went to  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changdeokgung> palace. Very nice walk in the woods, impressive architecture. I was doing this for hours, hard to appreciate at some point. Very very hot.

Polcari Sweat, good little gatorade like drink.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheonggyecheon> walk along stream. Ate mung bean pnacakes from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangjang_Market> . My belly is confusing me. The frying oil and hot smell really turned me off in that moment. But after a little bite my hunger came back.

# Conference day 1

Watched the egglog tutorial. Had chats with Max W
unapply
LE-matching
Talked to Chris and Yihong

Paper on levels should check out
Yihong suggested

Weakness of bottom up

# Conf Day 2 EGRAPHS

## FHE using egraphs

Hybrid approach. Use ordinary rewriting tecnnique but record everything in egraph.
More flexible optimal objectvtie
side car egraph. Interesting. No ematching.
ILP extraction

Maybe I should swap in a python hash cons, use pypy?

## Jijimodelin and constraint detection

specific types can be constraints to be exlppite.
one hot
SOS 1 2
solvers provide dedicated apis
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06495>

<https://github.com/orgs/Jij-Inc/repositories?type=all>

## Molecualr dynamics simulations

notions of equivalence.
axiomatic.
distirbtuitions equivalence
functional equivalance

Interesting.
Allowed error equivalence I've htought about.

Stochastic search

Nonstanard arith egraph. Bake in something...   a =O(n^2) b  implies higher powers.
Refining towers of equivalences. Lines, oreitned lines. Can be encoded.

## eqsat - mlir

lean mlir
lean egg benchmarks?
herbie becnhmoarls
fpcore

mlir dialect to have eclasses

%c = eqsat.eclass
use reigions to express cycles
rebuilding is a compiler transformation

CSE is used for eclass merging

pdl dialect fro pattern rewriting

## Theory instantiation yardbird

bounded model checking

rust bounded model checking

external quantifier instnations

abstract out to z3. use egraph rules to instntiate them.

## Automated high level synthesis

## destructive rewrites

can delete.
garage collect stuff that has no references
must make sure egraphs stays groundable, well founded

pruning vs destructive rewrites

Pavel was saying what about anti-extraction that throws away worst terms

chris calls subsume operator.

## incremental equality saturation

no sharing

batched eqsat. Pavel

current term.

ematching top level must be only latest version

top k goodness for previous enodes.
"ruaway eclass problem"

m wll expllored. do not explore well explored eclasses. m=2

chris says I should pull out "i reserve the right to change anything"

# Oatlog

for (x,y,z) in Mul:
    for (x,y) in Add(x):

overload iter and call. Interesting.
by key?

eager commutation applying
invariant permutation pruning

what about wasm generation
