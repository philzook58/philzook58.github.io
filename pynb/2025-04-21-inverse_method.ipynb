    "title: The Inverse Method is a Good Fit for Datalog Theorem Proving\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse method on first glance feels like an oddball. But actually it is rather straightforward when viewed from a datalog lens. The inverse method is a bottom up theorem proving method (typically for a sequent calculus) that finds demand for judgements by inspecting the input formula and using the subformula property of the cut-free sequent calculus. It is very schematically similar / identical to datalog methods for demand or magic set. The main thing that is a little annoying is you probably want a first class set for storing contexts $\\Gamma$\n",

    "# Demand in Datalog\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a common pattern in datalog that you need to explicitly model your demand. The core of datalog searches for facts and spews out new facts in a growing database. If you define a function-like relation in the most naive way, like fibonacci or factorial or append or what have you, the database will grow forever.\n",

    "The magic set transformation is a variation of this idea. I've been vaguely talking about modelling functional programming, but you also model prolog inside of datalog. Functional programming is a single `f(+, -)` mode https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=modes of prolog. Mode is one of the cooler ideas of prolog. The neat trick of prolog is some programs can be run from input to output or output to input or output and input to bool or partially instantiated in both. This is not actually the case because depending on how you write it, you may want to use imperative constructs or oftentimes the computation will diverge in certain modes.\n",

    "The magic set transformation is a way to make need predicates that create demand and answers for all the different modes possibilities. https://souffle-lang.github.io/magicset https://users.informatik.uni-halle.de/~brass/lp07/c7_magic.pdf\n",

    "Another connection to note is that the demand and result predicates can be merged in extended datalogs with either lattices or egglog. Egglog produces abstract identifiers as the result when you call `(fib 10)`, which rewrite rules can eventually ground/union to concrete results. A lattice datalog using a Maybe lattice where None means \"don't know result yet\" can also work.\n",

    "It is actually quite confusing what the rules of logic should be once you start questioning them, but a place to start are natural deduction and sequent calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural deduction https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-deduction/ was designed to have moves that formalize how a human might search for a formal proof. The older Hilbert style systems are like programming in combinators and ND is a bit more like programming in a functional language by the Curry Howard correspondence. Natural deduction systems have introduction and elimination rules for each logical connective like `and` `or` `implies`. Introduction rules have the central connective below the line and elimination have it above\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequent calculus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus instead has Left and Right rules depending on whether the central connective appears in the left or right side of the produced (below the inference line) sequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The act of transforming a sequent calculus proof into a natural deduction proof is quite interesting https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/atp/handouts/ch3-seqcalc.pdf . There is a story that the sequent represents the state of a partial natural deduction proof. The hypohteses represent the things we've got bottom up proofs of, and the conclusions are the things we have backwards processed the goals into.\n",
    "\n",
    "A thing people like is the cut elimination theorem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-elimination_theorem which shows that you can take a proof that uses a cut rule and remove it in terms of the other rules. It is a proof transformation method. In some respects, it is similar to other more familiar operations like [negation normal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation_normal_form) or [conjunctive normal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form) which are used to eliminate classical connectives (cut is not a connective though). These are usually presented in a semantic satisfiability preserving way, but could be presented in a proof transformation style also.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have cut removed, every inference rule of the propositional sequent calculus has only subformulas of the piece below the line go above the line. This is the subformula property and it lets you finitize the bottom up search space with demand. Doing so is the inverse method.\n",
    "\n",
