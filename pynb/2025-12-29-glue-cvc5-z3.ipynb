    "# Ignore SAT\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is a conventional story where you explain SAT solvers first, and then how to extend them with theories, I think it's kind of interesting conceptual approach to take the starting point as the theory combination problem and totally ignore the SAT part. Half or more of an introductory talk is about how backtracking and CDCL kind of works. Our solver will only consider problems of the form `p /\\ q /\\ not r /\\ ...`. This seems more relevant for the needs of a saturating solver like EMT anyhoo.\n",

    "Let us just say we have a pile of solvers that accept only conjunctions of literals. How can we combine them?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Externalizing Nelson Oppen out of Z3\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting illustration of this problem can be found by externalizing the theory combination problem out of Z3 and into the python layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you make multiple `Solver` objects in z3, they do not communicate to each other. However, we are staying entirely inside of z3, so some things remain easier to translate between solvers than if the solvers were truly foreign\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic steps are purification and then propagation. Purification separates statements into theory specific parts by flattening them using fresh symbols, and then dispatching them to the appropriate solver based on some criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a routine to flatten an expression"

    "The problem a SAT solver is solving is conceptually straightforward, basically try to guess an input to a digital circuit to make it's output true. More specifically, the input is expected to be in conjunctive normal form (a giant AND of ORs, the analog of a product of factors). One methodology to solve the problem algebraically is to convert this into disjunctive normal form https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form  (a giant OR of ANDs), FOILing out the factors. In DNF, the solutions are very explicit. In fact the DNF is an explicit spelling out of all the satisfying assignments. Doing this expansion eagerly is not a very good method, but other methods can be viewed as an incremental or partial DNF expansions if that is a useful perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is both lazy and eager SMT styles. In eager SMT, you can compile higher level constructs into a big SAT problem. You can do this for integers if you figure out any bounds on their size, you can bit blast bitvector arithmetic, and you can even do this for the theory of uninterpreted functions, encoding the relevant possible egraphs into SAT using booleans representing the equality of terms and clauses restricting you to congurence closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "SAT solvers are astonishingly well engineered and heuristicified, so this is sometimes a winning strategy, despite possibly needing pretty big encodings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fully Lazy SMT abstracts over theory specific reasoning like over facts `x > 3` as an opaque boolean `p` from the perspective of SAT solving algorithms. The SAT solver does its thing and reduces the problem to suggested conjunction of literals from the DNF `p /\\ q /\\ not r /\\ ...`. Now we can try to use theory specific solvers to try and solve the conjunction form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Waiting for the SAT solver to give you a fully finished boolean model may be unnecessarily expensive. SMT solvers usually have a tighter intertwining of the SAT solver with the theories, where theories are informed of decisions when they happen. This gives them an earlier opportunity to reject the current boolean model.\n",

    "But this has the perspective that the values are somehow a priori meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another perspective is that the value symbols like `2` are part of the signature. For another constant to have that value in the model just means both the value symbol and the constant x map to the same thing in the model. This feels more like a set theory-ish untyped notion of model. As a part of the syntactic theory are all the axioms necessary to make the value constants distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we only want uninterpreted constants and `=` to be the shared pieces of the signature, we can't transmit values between solvers. This isn't _so_ bad because we can inside each theory equate constants to these values and then learn disjointness during propagation.\n",

    "\n",
    "One thing I find pretty interesting is that splitting a theory amongst multiple solvers means they won't necessarily return the same values.\n",
