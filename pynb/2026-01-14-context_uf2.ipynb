    "\n",
    "Something that is desired in egraph rewriting is rewriting under assumptions. The canonical example of this is writing inside the branches of an if-then-else `if x = y and y != 1 then x/y else x+2`. Obviously in one branch we know that `x/y` can be reduce to the constant `1`. However, we do not know that `x=y` globally. Another case that Eytan showed was `max(x,y) - min(x,y) = abs(x - y)` where we may want to split into `x > y` and `x <= y`. You may also want assumptions to just see if you can make progress in an expression and then output those assumptions later (people do this sort of thing to try and simplify traces from a symbolic executor by assuming non aliasing of addresses). Or for assumptions in the subcases of a inductive proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique of assume nodes https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01839 gives a way to encode this into an egraph rewriting system. The colored egraph work https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19203 tries to bake this in.\n",
    "\n",
    "As is often the case, I think there is a lot to be learned by taking a step back to look at the simpler case of a contextual union find. I think it's actually fairly straightforward. The colored egraph paper mentions but does not go into much detail about the union find.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to maintain a hierarchy of union finds. Unions asserted into the child union finds should not affect the parents, but find operations inside the children may have to look inside the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can assume the parent union find stays fixed, that simplifies things. Then a persistent union find https://usr.lmf.cnrs.fr/~jcf/publis/puf-wml07.pdf (or a union find using persistent hash maps) may be acceptable. This is the sort of thing that occurs in a backtracking solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we basically want to assume the case where new equalities are being discovered both in the global union find and in the child union finds and then the children receive the updates from the parent, but not vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sparse and Dense Unions Finds\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least 3 flavors of union find. One flavor uses refcells, another uses a vector arena, and a third uses hashmaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "I like the latter 2 more because it gives you a handle on the entire union find as a single entity, which can be useful for sweeping if need be.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the vector arena style. It's nice that it only requires a vector and hence has fast lookup. A root of the union find is represented by a self reference loop. One could also use `None`.\n"

Using a python set is the simplest. This set can also be reduced with respect to the parent union find as part of a compression and/or rebuilding.\n",
