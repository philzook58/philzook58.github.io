    "title: \"Towards an AC Egraph : Grobner, Graver Bases and Ground Multiset Rewriting\"\n",
    "date: 2024-10-16\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "[Egraph](https://egraphs.org/) rewriting is a methodology for optimizing expression. A known problem is that some of the rewrite rules explode the egraph in size for what feels like common administrative manipulations like `a + b = b + a` or `a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post https://www.philipzucker.com/linear_grobner_egraph/ I described a methodology for extending the egraph by replacing the union find with more theory specific equational solvers. From this perspective, the union find (ground atomic equations) is in a spectrum of theories for which knuth bendix completion is guaranteed to terminate. When we have a class of equations that are guaranteed to be completable, it means we can throw together discovered application specific equations and get a normalizing rewrite system out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The union find is a normalizer for ground atomic equations like `a = b, b = c`, whereas row echelon from and groebner bases are normalizers for linear and polynomials equations. Once we have a normalizer, we can canonize our \"eclass ids\". When we \"union\" we insert a new application specific equation into the theory solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting common theme that I think is developing is that of \"structured eids\". This is the place we can place theory specific equational solvers. Other examples that have this feel are the extra structure in slotted egraphs, which carry the bound variable slots in the eid or colored egraphs where eids carry a context. In hindsight, egg 1.0 style analyses can be seen as a kind of a lattice \"structured eid\" consisting of a tuple of regular eid and lattice value. Another structured eid example is the \"group\" union find that can tag union find edges with a group action https://www.philipzucker.com/union-find-groupoid/ .\n",
    "\n",
    "String knuth bendix https://www.philipzucker.com/string_knuth/ is what you might use if you want an intrinsic bolted in notion of concatenation, a \"sequence egraph\". In other words, wee can label some operators as intrinsically associative. String knuth bendix is not guaranteed to terminate and is less well behaved than Grobner basis production. In this case the \"structured eids\" are strings/lists/vectors/sequences of eids.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common request is for associative and commutative theory. I a little bit suspect people want this for operators that are actually commutative ring-like, for which groebner basis are more appropriate. Nevertheless, there _is_ a thing that is guaranteed to complete the equations for AC theories.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view this AC solving thing from different angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grobner bases for toric/binomial systems like `x y^2 z - x = 0`. Under buchberger's algorithm, this binomial strucutre is maintained. You can write this as `x y^2 z = x`. The \"AC-ness\" is coming from that multiplication is associative and commutative in commutative algebra. Each monomial is a multiset of the variables.\n",
    "- Hilbert bases - hilbert bases are generating set of cone (positive combination of vector) restricted to lattice (integer) points. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_basis_(linear_programming)\n",
    "- Graver bases - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graver_basis are a finite basis of the integer points of `Ax=0` such that any vector can be written as a linear positive integer sum of them and they are minimal according to a well founded (terminating) order.\n",
    "- Ground Multiset Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the last perspective is the most direct, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also quite interesting that all of these can be used to solver integer linear programming problems. You can convert your problem into an appropriate basis and then you have a greedy fast no-search algorithm to solve it after that is done. The caveat is of course that finding this basis or completed rewrite system is very expensive. We'll show an example later\n",
    "\n",
    "# Theories and Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "If I take a binary expression `(x + y) + (z + x)`, there are different data structures that feel appropriate for the different axioms I might assume. I discuss this also here https://www.philipzucker.com/hashing-modulo/\n",
    "\n",
    "If I have no axioms, I can use a tree. `((\"x\",\"y\"),(\"z\",\"x\"))`\n",
    "\n",
    "If I have C, I should sort these tuples. `((\"x\",\"y\"),(\"x\",\"z\"))`\n",
    "\n",
    "If I have A, I can drop parens. a List is appropriate `[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"x\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "If I have AC, I should sort the list `[\"x\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]` or equivalently collect up the multiple counts `[(\"x\", 2), (\"y\", 1), (\"z\", 1)]`. This is a multiset data structure. Maybe you want to use a dictionary `{\"x\": 2, \"y\": 1, \"z\": 1}`. Same diff.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I have ACI, I should sort and dedup the list `[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]`. This is a set data structure. Maybe you want to use some more clever set data structure. Same diff.\n"

    "# Ground Multiset Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so we want to bolt AC into the egraph. I claim then that a good notion of \"eid\" is a multiset. The way we normalize these \"eids\" is by rewriting them using a completed ground multiset system, the appropriate generalization of the union find for this case.\n",

    "The way we do this is we follow exactly the same generic lines as all completion procedures.\n",
