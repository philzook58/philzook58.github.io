    "title: SMTLIB as a Compiler IR I\n",
    "date : 2026-02-09\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "I like SMT solvers. Compilers are cool. What kind of babies can they make?\n",
    "\n",
    "A design trick that has lead me to interesting places is to abuse the z3py AST more thoroughly than any sane person would do. Z3 already has very reasonable AST for describiing logic, bitvector operations, functions, reals, and integers. But, if you do it right, in addition to just an AST, you also get semantics and a magic solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compilers are nice because they are a pretty well specified problem that is actually useful. Reasoning principles and technology can be applied to make code faster. Bad reasoning can make output code buggy even when the input wasn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least two ways to approach what a compiler IR is:\n",
    "1. It is basically pure expressions that we start bolting stateful stuff onto\n",
    "2. It is basically imperative code / slightly abstracted assembly that we sometimes find pure subpieces of to help do optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "I tend to be 1 and that is the approach I'll be taking today.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SSA is Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my favorite papers is SSA is Functional Programming https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/ssafun.pdf . From this perspective, the core of SSA is a bunch of mutually defined recursive definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Static Assignment (SSA) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single-assignment_form is a compiler IR that people have noticed makes some compilation subproblems more straightforward. Variables can be only assigned once. You can kind of do this by making any subsequent assignments go to a fresh variable and replace later reads by reading from that fresh variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take the example program from the paper and write it in python\n",
