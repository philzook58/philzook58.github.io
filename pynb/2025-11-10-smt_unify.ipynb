    "# Using an SMT solvers as a boolean propagator\n",
    "\n",
    "Propagation is an essential pieces of SMT solving. The theory specific solvers have mechanisms to cheaply propagate information from the current assumptions. These are things like tightened inequality bounds implying other bounds, propagation of equality facts through congruence, unit propagation etc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tETbivwzXBM\n",
    "\n",
    "Once propagation has stopped learning anything (reached a fixed point) to make more progress perhaps you need to branch on a boolean variable, which enables more propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is somewhat unfortunate that these bare propagation mechanisms are not available to end users. However, using block box smt queries, we can do some propagation from the outside at some extra overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a pile of facts we think might be implied by an assertion, we can filter out the ones which have models for which they are false. Another way of putting it is this means the set constrained by the result is a subset of the assertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this manner we can probe the SMT solver to do bounds propagation, congruence closure, etc for us, just so long as we can enumerate the facts we might like to be propagated."
