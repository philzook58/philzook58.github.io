    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things that I've punted on for a while are overloading, typeclasses and algebraic hierarchies in [knuckledragger](https://github.com/philzook58/knuckledragger), my low barrier python proof assistant built around z3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proofs assistants I'm most familiar with have (multiple) mechanisms for some form of overloading and bundling of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things I find the most interesting about building knuckledragger is playing with the distinction between metalayers. The two main layers are\n",
    "\n",
    "- python programming (\"compile time\", static, meta)\n",
    "- z3 expressions (\"run time\", dynamic, object)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I can make a python dataclass to hold z3 expressions or I can make a z3 record datatype to hold them. It is typically easy to convert from the z3 level up to the python, but not so easy to convert from the python to z3. Conversely, the python layer is usually more ergonomic and familiar. It is kind of similar to things you can do generating C code from python or the [staged metaprogramming](https://okmij.org/ftp/meta-programming/index.html) game in general. As an example, you can have a meta `Forall` quantifier that unrolls a finite domain at \"compile time\" or you can let z3 handle it. This is akin to loop unrolling at compile time vs letting the C compiler handle it (probably better).\n",
    "\n",
    "here are some of the other layers. I don't think this is a linear ordering, maybe there are 2 or 3 axes in here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- wacky python metaprogramming and metaclasses\n",
    "- python types\n",
    "- class definitions\n",
    "- instances of classes\n",
    "- regular python functions\n",
    "- z3 sorts\n",
    "- z3 expressions\n",
    "- Proofs\n",
    "- shallow embedding of logics inside z3\n",
    "- deep embedding of logics inside z3\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the design game and confusion is which of these layers I want to associate with features in other systems. What pieces from which layer should I use to implement X feature from Lean? Copying features from dependent type systems clouds the waters, because they have punctured the metalayers in a particular way The very idea of putting values in types is a puncturing and also the idea of first class proof objects is a puncturing imo. To some extent, the whole game of foundations since Frege and Russell has been finding fun meta puncturings that retain soundness. [Quotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00405) or [modalities](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-provability/) are intriguing different forms of puncturing."

    "## SortDispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "From very early on Knuckledragger has had SortDispatch, a variation on [functools.singledispatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.singledispatch) for the purposes of overloading. I consider being in the standard library a stamp of idiomatic approval for the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple enough. You can make a python object that you can register new supported types into, and has a `__call__` implementation that which lookups the python type / python sort of the first argument in the registry dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were collapsing the layer of z3 sorts and python types, which we aren't, one could use `functools.singledispatch` to dispatch on the type of the first argument. Instead we need to make a new dispatch that calls `registry[arg0.sort()]` rather than `registry[type(arg0)]` to figure out which function to call.\n",
    "\n",
    "These registration dictionaries has developed as a common pattern. It is also what `functools.cache` is doing. Most of my mechanisms have something like this in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first though on how to support operator overloading is to just make new clases. I don't think this works well because I don't want to associate z3 sorts with python classes.\n",
    "Python supports operator overloading through implementing certain \"dunder\" methods like `__add__`. The most common and natural to achieve overloading is to make new classes or subclasses. But for the purposes of knuckledragger, I want overloading based on the `z3.SortRef` of the `z3.ExprRef`. One design choice could be to try an shallowly embed the z3 sorts into the python type system. You could do this my subclassing `ExprRef`, and this is what z3py itself does. However, I'd need to rewrap all z3 functionality to find the appropriate python class to subclass into. If I had the ability to change z3py maybe this is what I'd have done.\n",
    "Another choice is to wrap z3py expressions as a data member in a another class. I think the shallow usage of z3py makes my life easier and is a valuiable feature for users, so this is not great. Another choice might be to try and add a type parameter to `ExprRef[T]` where T is the z3 sort. Also weird and overwrought imo.\n"

If you have extensible functions, you can implement typeclasses at the user level. If you have a staged metaprogramming system like MetaOcaml, you can do have this mechanism run at compile time. Pretty cool.\n",

I think the search and inference of types vs lookup in a registry aspects can be fruitfully uncoupled. I might still make some kind of prolog/minikanren available. That Z3 sorts are basically atomic takes a bit of the point out of it. The z3py bindings don't expose type parameters to datatypes, and getting the pieces of Seq or Array types is possible, but I'm not sure I need an open mechanism for just those two cases\n",

I have found even changing names I don't like to be too much cognitive load. An accurate assessment of how many mental balls I can juggle is crucial. Once you do have enough stuff to make translation close to syntactic, you can get a lot more distance translating an existing formalization rather than trying to do it de novo, even if I have good grasp of the underlying math.\n",
