    "title: Term Ordering Etudes\n",
    "date : 2024-09-23\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Term orderings are a key concept in term rewriting and equational reasoning. Equations are my preferred form of mathematics. In particular, well founded term orders, meaning terminating, term orderings are used to prove termination and orient equations into terminating rewrite systems during completion. This orientation enables simplification and subsumption of your equational set, which leads to be efficiency gains over naive equational search.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've found the definitions of term orderings to be so dense as to be inscrutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I've soaked on it a while and have some nuggets of understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can fiddle around with the post here https://colab.research.google.com/github/philzook58/philzook58.github.io/blob/master/pynb/2024-09-23-term_ordering.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "# Term Orderings with Variables Have to Be Partial\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the confusion comes from having to deal with variables in your terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable are really useful though. They achieve pattern matching. Pattern matching is too dang useful to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ground terms (no variables), things are more straightforward https://www.philipzucker.com/ground_kbo/ Size of terms more or less works fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly strings are more straightforward. Order by size, then tie break lexicographically. This is called shortlex https://www.philipzucker.com/string_knuth/ . Via flattening, ground terms are a subproblem of strings. This is not the case if your term language includes pattern variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to consider a demon trying to subvert your picked order. Variables are intended to stand in for some arbitrary other term. If the demon can pick a term to instantiate your variable that switches your opinion on the ordering, the demon has won.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why `x = y` can never be ordered (at least if you have any opinions about concrete terms). If I say `x > y` the demon will instantiate `y` to something awful like `f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(a)))))))`and `x` to something nice like `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Homeomorphic Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "The homeomorphic embedding is the weakest (non strict) simplification ordering where a term is larger than any of it's subterms (the subterm property). The some degree it is defined as taking the subterm property and then making the order closed under instantiation of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you shrink a term by fusing out some inner nodes, it gets smaller in some sense. You can't keep cutting and fusing nodes forever. You'll eventually be left with a leaf and be stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between a fused out tree and the original is the homeomorphic embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition given in Term Rewriting and All That (TRAAT) can be read as an algorithm for finding an embedding. This algorithm is a straightforward recursive search. Your current pair is either a pair that are identified or a pair for which the one side was fused away and replaced with one of it's children.\n",

Macro expansion for a well stratified (bodies only have previously defined symbols) sequence of macros obviously terminates no matter how explosive the growth of the macros are. So size isn't really the issue there. But an ordered count of symbols is sufficient in this case. Plus really I think macros terminate by induction on the number of rules you've defined. empty rule sets terminates. If you have a rule set that terminates and add a new rule that is only defined in previous symbols, this also terminates.\n",
