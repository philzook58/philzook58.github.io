    "Term orderings are a concept that is both obvious and bizarre.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the one hand, of course when we are rewriting terms to make better expressions, we are trying to make \"simpler\" or \"better\" ones. Or we are seeking normal forms by a process that has to stop because there is a lower bound on how simple a term can get. When we tease this concept out, yea, there is some kind of [well founded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-founded_relation) ordering on terms, an objective function perhaps, we are trying to maximize or minimize. Well founded is roughly (exactly?) a mathematical definition of what it means to be terminating.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the addition of variables and the constraints of playing nicely with rewriting and substitution are more complex than one might hope. Variables + good substitution also _require_ the ordering become partial and that the commutativity axiom `X + Y = Y + X` cannot be ordered, because some demon could always find a way to pick `X` and `Y` to defeat your ordering choice. Partial orderings are more confusing than total orderings. Not unbearably so, but more.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it is very conceptually important to simplify to the non-variable case first. The definitions simplify and become closer to obvious\n",
    "\n",
    "Knuth Bendix ordering (KBO) is ordering by (weighted) size with a recursive tie breaking \n",
    "https://www.philipzucker.com/ground_kbo/ . This is an obvious idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial orderings I think may be the most intuitive, but I've actually spent the least time with them\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexicographic path ordering (LPO) has eluded me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I have implemented a ground version of it with some property tests. I think seeing some bulk output gives me better intuition for what it is doing.\n",

    "# Examining an enumeration\n",

    "Note that this enumeration is not enumerating the \"next\" term in the total order, it's just enumerating some random terms. There sometimes isn't a \"next\" term. An arbitrary number of `f` applications is still better than a single `g`. This is like the situation in the ordinals https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number , or more simply a pair of Nats. There is no particular thing that is \"one less\" than `(1,0)`. `(0,9999999)` is still less than `(1,0)` by lex ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordering should really have `...` in some positions\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[a,\n",
    " b,\n",
    " f(a),\n",
    " f(b),\n",
    " f(f(a)),\n",
    " f(f(b)),\n",

    "This intuition is that the ordering wants the arguments to the \"worse\" symbols to decrease, and it willing to pay a very large cost in terms of the other symbols to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an intuition that the symbol ordering can be thought of as a definition or call graph ordering in the case of functional programming. We can define `*` recursively in terms of `+` and `*`. When we unfold the definition of `*`, we gain many many `+` nodes, but this is ok, because we've reduced the argument to `*`. Likewise for worse things like ackermann functions. Probably symbols that are \"constructor like\" like `cons` should go very low in symbol ordering, and the symbol ordering of functions should roughly follow the definition ordering. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of looking at this is that the ordering kind of like pushing \"bad\" symbols deeper inside the term and raising \"good\" symbols higher up in the term.\n"
