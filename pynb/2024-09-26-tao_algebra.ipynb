    "title: Knuckledragger Solvers for Terence Tao's Equational Reasoning Challenge\n",

    "Terence Tao has put forward an interesting equational reasoning challenge.\n",

    "- https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/110736805384878353\n",
    "- https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/09/25/a-pilot-project-in-universal-algebra-to-explore-new-ways-to-collaborate-and-use-machine-assistance/\n",

    "It is reminiscent of a famous success story of automated theorem proving, proving the robbins algebras are boolean https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/papers/robbins/ a previously unsolved conjecture which was shown by Bill McCune's EQP solver in 1996. Hopefully solvers are a lot more powerful now.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been fiddling with building a semi-automated proof assistant in python called Knuckledragger.  https://github.com/philzook58/knuckledragger \n",
    "\n",
    "Knuckledragger is structured around Z3, but recently I've been bolting in the various automated solvers. Z3 is excellent at many things (first class at the grounded problems one often encoutners in software verification), but weaker at quantifier reasoning or equational reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these, Vampire, eprover, Twee, Zipperposition, and Prover9 are good candidates. I judge this somewhat by examining the CASC https://tptp.org/CASC/J12/ results\n",
    "\n",
    "What I've done is built a pretty printer to the first order and higher order TPTP format. This printer is wrapper around by a Solver object that mimics exactly Z3's python api so that I can swap it in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you don't buy into what I'm generally doing in Knuckledragger (a system to weave these results kind of Hilbert style into larger proofs), I think having easy installation and programmatic access to the solvers in python could be quite useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to the solvers is not new. Isabelle https://isabelle.in.tum.de/ and Why3 https://www.why3.org/   also both have these solvers accessible if you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TPTP organization https://www.tptp.org/ , largely orchestrated by Geoff Sutcliffe, has many resources, but especially System on TPTP https://tptp.org/cgi-bin/SystemOnTPTP , which lets you submit problem files online without installing these solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One big advantage of python is the massive preexisting ecosystem and infrastructure. Case in point. You can try this blog post out on Google collab quite easily by clicking this link https://colab.research.google.com/github/philzook58/philzook58.github.io/blob/master/pynb/2024-09-26-tao_algebra.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this cell will install Knuckledragger and the external solvers. It'll take a good 5 minutes to do all that compiling. Have faith. It could ber better when I ship a binary for eprover."
