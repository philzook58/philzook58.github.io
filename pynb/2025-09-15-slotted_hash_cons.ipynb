    "Slotted e-graphs https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3729326 are a data structure that compactly stores many equivalent terms in an alpha invariant aware way. I've been very excited by them but also very confused by them.\n",

    "There are sometimes existing versions of fancy e-graphs, fancy union find, and fancy hash conses for which the other counterparts is not discussed or kept implicit. For the slotted e-graph, there was surely be a slotted union find and a slotted hash cons simplification should you choose to not use those capabilities.\n",

    "# Beta vs Alpha\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpha invariance is noting that the actual names of variables don't matter in some (usually subtle) sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "People have a tendency to go right for lambda and beta normalization (beta is substituting into the body of a lambda), but this is a curse. Lambda is the Ultimate Pain in the Ass (LUPITA). There is a design philosophy that suggests that baking in full beta reduction into some automated reasoning systems is too much to ask. The canonical thing I have in mind is [higher order unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)#Higher-order_unification), for which the full beta normalizing higher order unification is undecidable (although not that bad in practice so I dunno).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two restricted variations of higher order unification that are decidable and in fact fast are:\n",
    "- Miller Beta0 Unification\n",
    "- Nominal Unification\n",
    "\n",
    "These restrictions more or less deal with a notion of unification modulo alpha equivalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also something to note that a distinction can be made between \"scoped\" alpha invariance (like lambda terms mod alpha) and \"unscoped\" alpha invariance (like resolution clauses or einstein notation).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you introduce an ordered binder for your alpha invariant variables canonizing these terms is easy by just examining the binding site. Just label the variables according to the order they show up in the binder. `canon(a [x,y,z]. f(x,y,z)) =  a [v0,v1,v2]. f(v0,v1,v2) = canon(a [p,q,r]. f(p,q,r))`\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way perhaps of distinguishing these two concepts is to consider ordered multi-arity binders  `a [x,y,z]. f(x,y,z)` vs a set-like multi-arity binder. `a {x,y,z}. f(x,y,z)`. The set-like character makes it a priori hard to figure out how to number your variables and you need to traverse into the term to tie break them, since the variables can have no structure in and of themselves without breaking alpha invariance. A \"binderless\" alpha invariant term could be seen as a implicit set-like binding at the top of the term. `f(x,y,z) ~> a {x,y,z}. f(x,y,z)`  \n",
    "\n",
    "I would claim that free variables as they show up in the locally nameless technique are binderless / set-bound because you kind of want a set like implicit variable environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Normalizing Alpha Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.philipzucker.com/hashing-modulo/ One method to hash something modulo a theory is to have a method for building a structurally canonical form and then hash that using regular structural hashing. For example, hashing a set of integers as represented by non canonical AVL trees or red-black trees (many AVL trees represent can represent the same underlying set) can be achieved by turning the set into a deduplicated sorted list or a trie. This is not the only possible method.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is actually easy to find an alpha canonical form. Just pick any deterministic method to traverse the tree and number variables as you find them. A preorder traversal works. `f(v0, g(v1, v0))`. This is what the prolog predicate `numbervars` does https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=numbervars/3\n"
