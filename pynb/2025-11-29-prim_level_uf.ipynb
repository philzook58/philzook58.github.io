    "I think this could make for a nicer experience possibly in egg or egglog, where you don't need functions to transfer between primitives and uninterpreted sorts. SMT does not require such a distinction and it is a small inelegance IMO to require it. eclass-like entities should behave more like SMT constants (like `smt.Int(\"x\")`) and primitive entities should be like SMT values (like `smt.IntVal(1)`). SMT allows these things to be equated.\n",

Here the levels of our union finds are indeed maintained in separate vector arenas. If we want to, we can scan the level as we pop it to do something like generalize. We also ensure when we pop a level, nothing from a higher level ever appears in the lower level tables. Still, the unions of the higher levels may transitively effect the lower level tables. It's an interesting variation of context.\n",

    "Like many structured eids, it may be desirable to store the extra data not as part of the eid, but in a separate table mapping eids to their levels `levels: list[level_num]`. This is the relationship between structured eids and egg style \"analyses\". The difference is something like a \"structure of arrays\" transformation. Similar to that, I think conceptually the structured eid concept is one notch simpler and the analyses style separate table is probably more efficient. \n",

When you do find, you first find in the delta uf, then you find in the parent uf. This turns out to not be guaranteed to be caonical, at least without freezing the parent. It requires a search procedure to find the canonical root. or accepting non canonicalness until a rebuild phase (which is ok I suppose).\n",
