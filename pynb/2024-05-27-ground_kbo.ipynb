    "Why do we want to compare terms? Well, having an ordering on terms enables the use of datastructures like balanced search trees.\n",

    "But also perhaps more crucially, it is a mathematical way of describing the notion of \"simpler\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic and obvious notion of simpler is to count the number of nodes in the term. Its size.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some term rewriting simplifiers we may write, we can know thew thing isn't going to loop (not terminate) if it always makes a little progress into a strictly simpler term. Presumably any reasonable order does not an infinite chain of simpler terms, so the rewriter has to stop eventually. We get rid of extra `0`, constant propagate, fuse out things like `-(-x) -> x` or `x - x -> 0`. All of these rules make smaller terms so we can't loop forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to show that a particular term rewriting system has this nontermination property, we need to find a term ordering. This term ordering has to comply with the fact that the left and right hand side of rules contain pattern variables, which may stand in for any term. This puts pretty strong and complicated constraints on the term ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "I find the definition of the knuth bendix ordering pretty confusing. And yet, when you consider the ground case, it all becomes much simpler and more obvious. This is a general rule of thumb for understand many techniques in automated reasoning. The ground stuff is a subcase and much easer.\n",
