    "It seems to me that telescopes https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/type+telescope , the dependently typed notion of context, is more central to the topic of dependent types than the dependent types are.\n",
    "\n",
    "A telescope is a sequence of variables and their type such that later types in the sequence can depend on the earlier variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "`[x : A, y : B(x), z : C(x,y)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the things often written as $\\Gamma$ in a typing judgement $\\Gamma \\vash t : A$ if you've seen such a thing. Another example might be `[A : Type, n : Nat, x : Vec n A]` for a having a list that is type constrained to be of length `n` in your current context.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have continued to think about this blog post https://www.philipzucker.com/frozenset_dtt/ which I rather like. By being vague and borrowing from the metalevel of python, I can kind of outline combinators that describe the simple finite set theoretic model of dependent type theory. This is a highly semantic approach to thinking about type theory and rarely the direction I see people go. Maybe they think it is so obvious it isn't worth mentioning or also they approach type theory as foundational and hence don't really want to appeal to some shitty half correct set-ty intuition to justify their inference rules. https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/MartinLofOnTheMeaning96.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection I made in that blog post is that this nested binding in telescopes is very similar to the binding structure you can have with nested for loops in an ordinary programming language\n",

    "            pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, somewhat vaguely, the set of python contexts that appear inside that loop represents of models the syntax of the telescope. In other words, the runtime environments $\\rho$ are the things in the typing context $\\Gamma$.\n",

    "# Relating Relational and Telescope Style Conjunctive Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Any telescope can be rewritten as a conjunctive query https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_query . Conjunctive queries look the like bodies of datalog rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take the convention that every n-argument \"dependent type\" is actually just a notation for an n+1 relation, we can turn telescopes into conjunctive queries. `[x : A, y : B(x), z : C(x,y)]` becomes $A(x) \\land B(x,y) \\land C(x,y,z)$. Perhaps writing `z : C(x,y)` as `elem(C(x,y),z)` and then fusing/flattening `elem` with `C` to `C'(x,y,z)` makes this more clear. We do have a notation to refer to a first class set, which is kind of interesing. Not sure how important this is.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can in turn can be written as the SQL query. SQL binds rows rather than the elements in the rows like a conjunctive query / datalog body does. It is however quite mechanical to translate them.  https://www.philipzucker.com/tiny-sqlite-datalog/\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "FROM A as a \n",
    "FROM B as b \n",
    "FROM C as c \n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "a.v0 = b.v0 AND\n",
    "b.v1 = c.v1 AND\n",
    "a.v0 = c.v0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Vice versa can also be achieved in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "$T(x,y) \\land T(y,z) \\land T(z,x)$ becomes `[x : Int, y : Int, z : Int, p1 : T(x,y), p2 : T(y,z), p3 : T(z,x)]`  or we could try to move the telescope around a little, which corresponds to lifting up loop invariant code in a for loop to `[x : Int, y : Int, p1 : T(x,y), z : Int, p2 : T(y,z), p3 : T(z,x)]` \n",
    "\n",
    "It seems in general it is easier to convert a telescope to a nice conjunctive query form than vice versa. Conjunctive queries have no restrictions on there being a nice ordering to the variables. There may not be a nice ordering or finding it is a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've notice in knuckledragger, which is a Hilbert style system that having your theorems in a \"standard form\" helps you write proof combinators that correspond to dependent type or sequent calculus rules. John Harrison's book makes a similar observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Telescopes and Conjunctive queries kind of correspond to two \"standard forms\" you might like your logical formulas to appear as\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Sequent form\" $\\forall x y z ... , ( A \\land B \\land C ...)  \\implies P$\n",
    "- Telescope form $\\forall x, A(x) \\implies (\\forall y, B(x,y) \\implies (... \\implies P))$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Always working in these two forms let's you form Hilbert style combinators that corresponds to sequence calculus rules or rules that look more like dependent type theory rules.\n",

    "## SQL-izing telescopes\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing that tries also triggers in my brain is database queries and worst case optimal join https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10841 which also are intimately connected to `for` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also strong correspondence between basic SQL queries and `for` loops. https://www.philipzucker.com/sql_graph_csp/\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the for loops correspond to the `FROM` statements, `if` statements correspond to `WHERE` clauses, and `yield` corresponds to `SELECT`\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm abusing the python ast parsers like here https://github.com/true-grue/python-dsls/blob/main/datalog/datalog_test.py to get a DSL without writing a parser. I'm reusing the python type comment syntax which if you squint lookx like a typing judgement. To make this more complete, I should support more interesting expressions inside the arguments of types and in the result type.\n"
