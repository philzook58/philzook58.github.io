    "title: \"Coset Enumeration using Equality Saturation\"\n",

    "\n",
    "As I was digging into computational group theory \n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_group_theory for string knuth bendix goodness  https://www.philipzucker.com/string_knuth/ I noted that coset enumeration aka Todd-Coxeter https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd%E2%80%93Coxeter_algorithm , one of the mainstay algorithms, mechanically looks quite a bit like equality saturation. This is interesting in it's own right but also as a source of controlled benchmarks for equality saturation systems.\n",

    "Groups are a particular algebraic structure for describing things with symmetry. Symmetries are changes that somehow leave something alone. Familiar examples include rotations and permutations. You can compose these things and invert them. Symmetries lead to good solution methods. PDEs become solvable by symmetry, symmetry breaking is important to reduce combinatorial search space\n",
    "\n",
    "A subgroup of a group is a set of group operations that are closed under the operations. 2D rotations are a subgroup of 3D rotations, or the even permutations are a subgroup of the permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define multiplying against a set of group elements as mapping the multiplication over all the elements of the set. When you do this to a subgroup, those are the cosets of that subgroup https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coset . Because group multiplication is invertible, this action is not compressive and you can map the subgroup to tile and partition the entire group with cosets. In this way we can decompose groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finitely Presented Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "To start attacking questions about a particular group, we need to ask how it is described / represented?\n",
    "\n",
    "A multiplication table suffices for rather small groups. For permutation groups of elements n, there are n! group elements. This table gets unusable pretty fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "So pretty often you need to come at the group from the side. Sometimes you might describe the group in terms of its action of some other set, like the set of all rubik's cube positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, a group is described as a finite number of generators and relations/equations between those generators. These are called finitely presented groups. This is what we'll work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we make a group generated as strings `abbbaaaabbbbaaa` but we identify `aa = 1` and `bbb = 1`. Sympy has a coset enumeration thing in it for us.\n",

    "\n",
    "The way coset enumeration works is by building coset tables and propagating / filling in equalities implied by the relations and by inverse. Mechanically it really does feel like a variation of equality saturation. I don't think there is persay an explicit union find under the hood anywhere though. Depending on how you model it, egglog will actually hold tables that correspond to the tables that appear in a coset enumeration implementation.\n"
