It is a natural approach if one wants a more rigorous solution to this problem to work within the language of SMT if possible rather than require \n",

However, it is outside the solver's purview to check the reasoning _linking_ user calls.\n",

At minimum it should store the formula in question that has been proven, but it may also contain a record/trace of the steps/api calls that led to it's production. A sufficiently complete API trace such that it can be replayed is a proof object/tree. Complete API traces are very powerful, for example a trace of all syscalls of a IO reading and writing program are succificent to completely determinize it.   \n",

    "## Structural Rules\n",

It is quantifiers and lambdas that can sometimes trip it up over even seemingly trivial reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been very tempting to extend `Proof` into a more sequent like form `Gamma |= P` rather than it's current Hilbert like form `|= P`. I don't really think there is that much point ultimately. Judgements with a context can be seen as Hilbert style judgements of a particular forms `|= And(Gamma) -> P` with derived combinators for manipulating them. An important class of combinator is one that reduces the `And` hypothesis such that it has set-like character. Any method for sorting and deduping the `Gamma` terms will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "There seems to be a pattern for record-like objects about whether to put the record character into the logic or keep it unpacked at the metalevel. The two layers are usually basically interconvertible."
