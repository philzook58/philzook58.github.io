    "title: Some Lean Syntax for Knuckledragger\n",
    "date: 2025-12-15\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "I have wired in the capability to use lean-like expression strings in places that accept formulas in knuckledragger https://github.com/philzook58/knuckledragger .\n",
    "\n",
    "Cody gave me feedback for how unreadable the python syntax (z3py syntax) for formulas is from his perspective. It's a fair point. It is a pretty laborious concrete syntax that probably has a 2x factor or more of junk python commas, etc in it. I have felt this pain, and now maybe it is time to make it a bit better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator overloading is one of the main sugaring mechanisms in Python. This isn't quite good enough because there isn't a natural operator for `forall`. A bigger issue is that there isn't a good operator for implies `->`. One might consider `>=` or `>>` but if you look up the precedence and associativity, it is all wrong and really the semantics of these operators does not line up correctly with the meaning of implies either. Also there is no good notation available for `forall` `lambda` and `exists`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing I've had in mind from the beginning of the project was to lean into using Lark https://github.com/lark-parser/lark parser grammars. Lark is a python LALR or earley parsing library. If you're in python, it's a reasonable choice I think for making DSLs. It is really nice to not need an extra build step to use them compared to yacc, menhir, lalrpop, or antlr. It is a regular python library. It also now supports pattern matching over the `lark.Tree` datatype, which makes for reasonably pleasant interpretation out of the parse tree (this is perhaps not the most machine efficient way to consume them though). It also support some degree of mixing together different grammars, making them extensible.\n"
