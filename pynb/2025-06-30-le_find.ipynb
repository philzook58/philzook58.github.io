    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Something I've been seeking for a while is a notion of a \"refinement e-graph\".\n",
    "\n",
    "What precisely I mean by the term is unclear, but I think there is definitely something here for multiple reasons (the pre-existing topics/techniques of birewriting and subtyping). This is an instance of what CF has called \"terminology driven development\" where one come's up with a phrase for a thing that should exists and meditate upon what it means and how to build it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest motivator for such a thing is dealing with the phase ordering of rewrites that are not bidirectional (they aren't actually oriented equations. They are for serious rewrites.). I was at a table at PLDI 2022 where Zach was pitching to John Regehr using e-graphs in Alive or LLVM and he said the thing SMT solvers aren't supplying are refinement from less defined expressions to more defined ones (also the need for arbitrary bitwidth solvers). The idea being that there is a perspective that the equality `x * y / y = x` is not correct. The issue is that `y=0` has a possible divide by zero. Nevertheless, the definitions of undefinedness and correct compilation in compilers is negotiated such that the rule _is_ allowed in one direction, the right hand side being well behaved in strictly more situations than the left hand side. So this is a unidirectional rewrite. Likewise for bit shifting by constants larger than the bitwidth, and integer overflow. THere are a couple examples like this that really have nothing to do with state/memory, are basically pure dataflow, but have some funkiness with regards to undefinedness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also Zach asked my in the QA section of [my talk last year](https://pldi24.sigplan.org/details/egraphs-2024-papers/13/E-graphs-and-Automated-Reasoning-Looking-back-to-look-forward) https://www.philipzucker.com/egraph2024_talk_done/ whether the ground Knuth Bendix view of the egraph (which has directional edges between the enodes in the eclass) has any bearing on this question. \n",

    "![](https://www.philipzucker.com/assets/egraph2024/egraph2.svg)\n",

    "The year before at [Oliver and Yihong's](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/details/egraphs-2023-papers/9/Ensuring-the-termination-of-equality-saturation-for-terminating-term-rewriting-system) talk about Tree automata views of the e-graph, the same question came up."

    "# Inequality Union Find\n",
    "\n",
    "As a baby step, we can discuss a union find that supports inequality assertions and queries in addition to the equational ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of an inequality union find is brutally simple once you ask the question, and I'm not sure there is anything super fancy/clever you'll ever be able to do to improve on the basic version of it. You're going to pay super linear cost for dealing with the inequalities. I don't think there is a free lunch here. The question is more so how to avoid materialization and how to make an elegant low level data structure (which I am only partially addressing since I'm sticking to python).\n",
    "\n",
    "A good inequality union find should elegantly degrade in performance compared to a regular union find. If you don't use inequalities much, the thing should be basically the same as a regular union find.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, you want to maintain in addition to the parents of the union find, upper and lower sets of bounds. There is an interesting opportunity for information propagation when you assert both `x <= y` and `y <= x` at which point it may make sense to union anything squished between the two (in the connected component with those nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the upper and lower sets, you have at least 2 possible design choices. Either make them grow as much as possible to cache/materialize the transitive closure of the `<=` relation, or make them as thin as possible to avoid duplicating information (in other words if `a <= b` and `b <= c` do not bother directly storing `a <= c` and instead compute it on demand by DFS).\n",
    "\n",
    "A different axis of design is whether to require that you never miss a `<=` once you've learned it, or whether it is ok to require an amoritized `rebuild` before you can be sure all `<=` are discovered, or even if sometimes not registering the `<=` is ok if it's too expensive to. One way of doing this last point would be to restrict an id's upper set to some fixed size like 3 or stop the transitivity DFS once it takes more than 10ns or something. These are pretty ad hoc restrictions, but so be it. By the general saturation paradigm, failing to confirm `<=` is not the same as concluding `>` or `not <=`. \n",
    "\n",
    "As I was looking through my notes, I saw that a \"poset union find\" from the Go compiler had come across my feed 6 months ago. So the concept is not unknown, although where is a real reference on it?\n",

    "The Go version I believe is using something akin to the union nodes in the aegraph to store the upper and lower sets as DAGs in an arena (like `unodes` here https://www.philipzucker.com/smart_constructor_aegraph/ ). This is probably a better low level implementation but using python sets makes what is going on more clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "An objection to using an inequality union find in the context of e-graphs / egglog is that datalog is already the perfect transitive closure engine isn't it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe, but there are a couple arguments against this perspective\n",
    "- This only supports the fully materialized version of transitive closure\n",
    "- Egglog is fully expressive (turing complete). You can encode literally anything into it. For really deep encodings, it's obvious that the encoding sucks and will immediately choke even if correct. It is the analog of saying that you can encode all of math to ZFC or peano arithmetic via many coding tricks, but from an automation perspective, this is nearly useless. Transitive closure encoded to rules is a mild / pretty shallow encoding, so you are only mildly screwed by using it.\n",
    "- This is part of a general paradigm of treating concepts as macro rewrites / encodings on egglog programs. I feel this approach is hitting a wall. Which is why I'm exploring ways of doing  egraph's modulo theories. I find having a runtime mechanism more satisfying in many respects to macro encoding something away\n",
    "\n",
    "An idea that I think was pretty interesting in this direction though is adding language level syntactic support to datalog for \"mediation\" by user defined relations.\n",
    " The pattern `Z = foo(bar(X))` considered as a datalog query flattens to `Z = W, foo(Y,W), bar(X,Y)`. A nice normal form of datalog doesn't use repeated variables, but instead makes them all unique, but related by `=`. `Z = W, foo(Y1,W), bar(X,Y), Y = Y1`. A user defined mediation would allow you to replace `=` with a different relation like  `eq(Z,W), foo(Y1,W), bar(X,Y), eq(Y,Y1)` or in the refinement matching case a user defined inequality relation  `le(Z,W), foo(Y1,W), bar(X,Y), le(Y,Y1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    " By the usual [dictionary of concepts](https://www.philipzucker.com/egraph2024_talk_done/), the inequality union find should correspond to a ground atomic theory of equality and inequality statements like `a = b /\\ c <= d /\\ a = c /\\ p = q`. \"Solving\" this system corresponds to running a generalized knuth bendix, saturation of ground knuth bendix + ground ordered chaining. This is overwrought in terms of conceptual complication though."

    "# Comments on Refinement E-Graphs and Connections to Algebraic Subtyping\n",
    "\n",
    "A new angle that has only come on my radar recently is that of subtyping ,which I became interested in for completely different reasons related to doing semantical refinement typing in Knuckledragger. In algebraic subtyping https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/stephen-dolan/thesis.pdf , Stephen Dolan speaks of the concepts of bisubstitutions and biunification. A significant distinction is made between terms and variables appearing in positive and negative / covariant and contravariant positions. This is a distinction that is not made or apparent in the equational counterpart. A good challenge problem for a refinement egraph is implement Hindley Milner with subtyping akin to Yihong's implementation of Hindley Milner. https://egraphs-good.github.io/egglog-demo/?example=typeinfer\n",
    "\n",
    "On a seemingly parallel but disjoint track is work in automated reasoning onm Ordered Chaining https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/293347.293352 (Bachmair & Ganzinger)  and Birewriting (Levy & Agusti) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074771719690053X in the 90s. As usual with term rewriting, engaging with the literature here is pretty difficult. So far as I can tell, Stephen Dolan is not influenced or referencing this work, although they are clearly related to my eye. \"Birewriting\" is perfect counterpart terminology to \"bisubstitution\" and \"biunification\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I think stating which arguments of functions are covariant/contravariant / monotonic / anti-monotonic is a key bit of extra data needed for refinement egraph rewriting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refinement egraph rewrite rules should look something like this `foo(X+) <= bar(X+)`. One seeks a bisubstitution of the pattern variables `foo(X)` and a term `t` in the egraph such that `t <= bisubst[foo(X+)]` from which one can assert the inequality `t <= bisubst[bar(X+)]` into the refinement e-graph. This is a more complicated operation one every step than equational matching and it seems that even bottom-up e-matching become nondeterminstic.  The reason is that at every point while building your term, you may transition into your upper set in order to build `t`. `t` was a function of the pattern and substitution in the equational case of bottom up e-matching but this is no longer the case. The ability of the LEFind to iterate over all id's larger than a given one is something you need to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could call this matching problem either \"bi-matching\" or \"le-matching\" (in reference to \"e-matching\"). It is in the general arena of e-matching, requiring search through all \"larger\" or \"smaller\" terms depending on whether you are in a contravariant or covariant position in the pattern.\n"

    " You can annotate a union find with things that aren't equal also https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3704913 in \"forbid lists\". Merged classes accumulate forbid lists, so it's similar to the annotated information idea0 \n",

    "   https://z3prover.github.io/papers/z3internals.html#sec-equality-and-uninterpreted-functions This also describes a method of splicing in a linked list to enumerate equivalence classes. I like Harold's description better. Chris' aegraph has union nodes for a related purpose. I think of those as storing \"right side up\" the tree that the union find is the upside down version of.Philip Zucker: I sometimes muse about tie breaking unions not on rank or whatever but by other criteria. Again, in the aegraph I believe it used a deterministic method (oldest or newest?). It is also interesting to force union(x,y) to make y the parent and x the child always. This gives programmer control which is kind of interesting.\n",
    "Maybe firing on false beauty, but there's something intriguing that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_refinement is dual to union finds in some sense. Union finds start all disjoint by assumption and merges. Partition refinement starts all merged by assumption and splits. This has never ended up being a useful observation to me. \n",
    "- Here's another one. I'm contrary, so I often just don't path compress or instead I do full eager compression of union finds in a \"rebuild\" pass, in both cases completely ruining the ackermann whatever. If you combine eager compression with a deterministic parent tie breaking (min for example), you can put a union find into a canonical form and then hash cons it for first class union finds.\n",
