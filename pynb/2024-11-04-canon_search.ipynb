    "\n",
    "For sets for example, canonizing a list representation of a set can be done by simply sorting it. Very natural, Eazy peasy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For lambda terms, a common canonical representation is [de bruijn indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index), which name variables by the number of binders you need to cross to reach their binding lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "For binderless alpha invariant things, like a term with unification variables, you can label the variables via a traversal. For example `f(X,Y,Y)`  becomes `f(V0, V1, V1)` traversing left to right. This particular strategy isn't stable and therefore is inefficient upon building a new term using this as a subterm, but it is conceptually ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when you start combining set-like things (Associative, commutative and idempotent) with variables, one gets stumped though. Procedures to name the variables and the procedure to sort the set are entangled. Which do we do first? \n",
    "\n",
    "One idea is to use a non-ground [term ordering](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/manual/2009-11A/term-order.html) to sort the sets. These non-ground term orderings are intrinsically partial though. Also they are way more complicated than anything we've discussed so far. This is more for dealing with substitution problems than alpha invariance problems. It is overkill.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also replace variables with a single marker type `V` and use that term as a invariant. This is kind of the idea used in discrimination tries.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we actually achieve the canonization approach rather than fingerprinting?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables + AC ~ Graph Isomorphism ===> Search\n",
    "I was stumped for while on how to canonize clause-like things, coming up with this and that criteria on naming the variables and breaking ties.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important revelation is to note that this problem is no going to be solvable in general without search. It is basically a variation of [graph canonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_canonization), which solves [graph isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism), something which for which a polynomial time algorithm is unknown. Once we've given up on the problem being search free, things become clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider canonizing the set of terms `{f(X,X), f(X,Y)}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take a step back from particular procedures and note that we are looking through the space of labellings of variables.\n",
    "`{f(v1,v1), f(v1,v0)}` or `{f(v0,v0), f(v0,v1)}` are the options here considering only vairables namings. In combination with list permutations this becomes `[f(v1,v1), f(v1,v0)]` or `[f(v0,v0), f(v0,v1)]` or `[f(v0,v1), f(v0,v0)]` or `[f(v1,v0), f(v1,v1)]`.\n",
    " \n",
    "Our procedures are trying to come up with some method to select one in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "A declarative approach is to come up with a criteria for which labelling is best. How do we compare these different possibilities? \n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting is like saying that we like the lexicographically least among the lists. In our example, that would be `[f(v0,v0), f(v0,v1)]`. Boom. That's our canonical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's the recipe:\n",
    "1. Describe the space of possible representations\n",
    "2. put some total ordering on it\n",
    "3. the minimum one is the canonical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a search problem throughout the space of possible representations, which will be typically very large. When we look at a particular problem, we will see many optimizations, propagations, and pruning steps that are possible. Many of the symmetries will factor. We can use noticed invariants to prune the space. For simple problems, these observations will prune the space down into a polynomial time algorithm. \n",
