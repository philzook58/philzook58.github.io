    "A few months ago I saw a talk on buildit, https://buildit.so/ a really neat project. One thing I came away with was a neat trick for getting non-overloadable syntax to be overloadable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interesting observation, which seems clear in hindsight (the best observations are), is that bool conversion _is_ overloadable by writing a `__bool__` function on the Z3 class. With a little hackery, you can record all the paths through a piece of fairly pure python code.\n",

    "# Partial Evaluation and MetaProgramming Z3\n",
    "\n",
    "I have noted for a while after tinkering with [MetaOCaml](https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/MetaOCaml.html) that metaprogramming z3 in python has a lot of the flavor of staged metaprogramming (big surprise? Maybe there's not much content to the observation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some metaprogramming frameworks or styles look very different from unstaged code. You explicitly call all sorts of weird functions to construct code obects.\n",
    "\n",
    "A really cool flavor of staged metaprogramming takes the unstaged code and adds some annotations to get staged code. The more similar the staged code looks to the original, the better. It probably takes some kind of quotation, overloading, or introspection mechanism to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "A canonical example of staged metaprogramming is unrolling a power function. Here is a simple example of an unstaged recursive power function operating on regular python ints."
