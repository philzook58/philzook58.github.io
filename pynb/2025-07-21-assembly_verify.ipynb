    "Title: Semi-Automated Assembly Verification in Python using pypcode Semantics\n",
    "date: 2025-07-21\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "I've worked on binary verification tooling for a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our projects, we've often been working on just binary garbage thrown out of a compiler or being reverse engineered or butchered in some other way. A strange lesson is that it is pretty tough to even know what \"good\" or \"correct\" should mean in absence of higher levels of source.\n",
    "\n",
    "An idea that I've liked is adding inline verification annotations into textual assembly somewhat similarly to how they feel in [Dafny](https://dafny.org/) or [Frama-C](https://www.frama-c.com/). This is the more cooperative version of the problem. There is a possible universe in which compilers output this sort of assumption/verification information either textually or dumped into binary metadata https://www.philipzucker.com/dwarf-patching/ . This would aid translation validation and binary verification immensely in terms of have a goal to verify against.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some design constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I strongly prefer that the file has to remain assemblable by the regular binutils toolchain. \n",
    "- An esoteric ecosystem is kind of a non starter if I want anyone to be using it. Another painful lesson. The intersection of low level interested and Ocaml/Lean/Coq interested is non-zero, but every constraint you put on your audience cuts it down significantly. Because of this, I've been leaning into more Python as a user facing language. It _is_ the most popular language in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pypcode](https://github.com/angr/pypcode) is a well packaged version of the binary lifters for the [ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) decompiler and can supply a unified semantics for many architectures. It's stable, well-maintained and funded (NSA). This is a pretty rare combo. I think the programming language and verification community are sleeping on this resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've attacked the problem in various ways before. This is yet another related angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://www.philipzucker.com/knuckle_C_pcode/ here I discussed a bit writing my symbolic pcode emulator based on the [official version](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/src/decompile/cpp/emulate.cc). The actual code is here https://github.com/philzook58/knuckledragger/blob/main/kdrag/contrib/pcode/__init__.py I'm using this sane symbolic executor today. The main difference between this and angr is that I don't partially concretize memory, which is a bit more complete. I tried to use angr quite a bit. Couldn't see how to achieve this (claripy seemingly doesn't even support the theory of arrays). I do however leverage angr's loader ecosystem CLE https://github.com/angr/cle\n",
    "- https://www.philipzucker.com/pcode2c-dwarf/ another apporach using pypcode to specialize an interpreter to C code so that you can compare to other C code via CBMC. Still an interesting approach for translation validation\n"

    "An easy way to make sure the file remains assembleable is to use macros that expand to mostly nothing when assembled, but that I can grep for to find the important metadata.\n",

    "A more heavy-handed way to go about it might be to build an entire assembly parser, but this is going to suck and not be as portable across architecture or assembler.\n",

    "5. What to check after every assembly instruction execution `kd_always`. These are kind of system ubiquitous invariants such as what I may want for \"memory is always untouched\" or interrupt invariants being satisfied\n"
