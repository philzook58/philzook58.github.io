title : PLDI 2025 and Egraphs Modulo Theories Talk
date: 2025-06-21

I gave a talk at EGRAPHS 2025 - Omelets Need Onions: E-graphs Modulo Theories via Bottom Up E-Matching [link](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/details/egraphs-2025-papers/5/Omelets-Need-Onions-E-graphs-Modulo-Theories-via-Bottom-Up-E-Matching) [slides](https://www.philipzucker.com/assets/eggmt_talk.pdf) [youtube](<https://www>.
youtube.com/live/AEbvKbHPRhM?si=Ub1wYG900AWSATkc&t=30760)

The motivation is how to bake in theory specific smarts like SMT solvers do. Discussions about the easiest form of e-matching (bottom up) when it comes to theories and also the idea of slotting in theory specific generalized unions finds, analagous vaguely to Shostak style SMT solvers.

Went pretty well I think! I had some technical difficulties at the beginning. I had tried my laptop earlier and it wasn't working. Somehow I assumed that the projector must be locked or something for the break and didn't question it? Jetlag is a hell of a drug. In hindsight there were a lot of options. Luckily Max let me use his laptop. I feel like gmail was also being wonky.

Some papers this year I would like to revisit in more depth

- Staged Mininkanren  <https://doi.org/10.1145/3729314>
- Exploiting undefined behavior. Limitting use of undef behavior didn't hurt perf much <https://doi.org/10.1145/3729260> once you enhance the analysis
- Slotted egraphs <https://doi.org/10.1145/3729326>
- Lambda join <https://doi.org/10.1145/3729299> functional streaming. Evocative of datafun kind of and stuff max is into
- Misaal <https://doi.org/10.1145/3729301> used egraphs? Syntehsis of compiler
- <https://doi.org/10.1145/3729309> First-Class Verification Dialects for MLIR
- <https://doi.org/10.1145/3729308>  Principal Type Inference under a Prefix: A Fresh Look at Static Overloading
- <https://doi.org/10.1145/3729338> Practical Type Inference with Levels. Are levels a levelled union find? Using vector arenas allocated when you go insde a let
- <https://doi.org/10.1145/3729298> Relational Abstractions Based on Labeled Union-Find

Had a blast! Having a core of people I know is so clutch. Also giving a talk is a nice ice breaker. I'm getting much better at just chatting with strangers as life goes on. In hindsight, I had career crippling social anxiety in my 20s. Maybe everyone does.

# Notes

![](/assets/pldi_2025.jpg)
Started my journey!
Was tinkering on my slides Tuesday and they locked into a workable form.
Plane was not nearly as horrible as I worried. Stood up every once in a while
Announced my coming on the various social media. Good technique. I have a hard time butting into conversations but like when people start one with me.

Algebraic Subtyping and biunification. Very long and full of protens

# 12

Big day of walking! Started up to the seoul tower. Very uphill.

I feel like I barely ate all day by accident. It was hard to pick a place.
I've also been a bit uncertain on whether card will be accepted?

I got ginseng chicken soup at this place. I keep getting drawn to lines.

# 13

Started day a little late. Practicing slides. Exhausted from yesterday. I keep crashing at 7pm and waking up at 2pm. I guess that works.

Bukchon Hanok village <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukchon_Hanok_Village>

Went to  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changdeokgung> palace. Very nice walk in the woods, impressive architecture. I was doing this for hours, hard to appreciate at some point. Very very hot.

Polcari Sweat, good little gatorade like drink.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheonggyecheon> walk along stream. Ate mung bean pnacakes from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangjang_Market> . My belly is confusing me. The frying oil and hot smell really turned me off in that moment. But after a little bite my hunger came back.

# Conference day 1

# PLDI day 1

## Keynote

Spectec for wasm
<https://github.com/es-meta/esmeta>

Could I print an smt interpreter out of these things?

## weval

I wonder if I could use this for pcode2c?
I'm not really sure what "this" is though.

## UB

great stuff. Actually seeing wha ub matters for perf. Focussing only on perf is smart.

overflow of int
shift by too much

The egg example is probably not true / overflows at the edges.

`(a + 1) - 1  = a` isn't strcitly speaking an equality?

## Staged Minikanren

## lambda join

## mlir

## hall track

Raved at Thomas Gilray about contextual and lambda datalog. The relationship of superposition and reoslution theorem provers to datalog. When he got going, it quite impressive the depth of work being done on gpu joins for datalog.

Chatted with Rudi over at te closest palace. It was funny, was totally oblivious to our surroundings. Very difficult to avoid getting smushed by cars. trying to clarify what slotted egraphs are. Indeed probably what I wrote in my slides was a wrong guess for notion of structured eid.
One interesting tidbit is that maybe slotted is more closlely modelling a concept of "lambda" that is multiarity and passes argument by keyword.
`{x = i, y = j} * e_42`
A slotted union find.
Rudi has a distinction between renaming and permutation. Permutations being amongst the same small sets of names (or permuting the slots?) whereas renaming is permutation in the inifnite set of names.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
@dataclass
class SlotID():
    rename : dict[str, str]
    id_ : int

class SlotUF():
    def __init__(self):
        self.uf = {}
    def fresh(self, nslots):

        eid = SlotId({"x" + i : "x" + i for i in range(nslots)}, len(self.uf))
        self.uf[]
    def find(self, sid):
        eid = s.id_
        rename = s.rename
        (rename1, id1) = self.uf[eid]
            if rename
```

If the group action was actually an invariance.
Negation group
0 = -0
neg(1) = -1

The self edge in the union find should accumulate the symmettrices the things respects with respect to the group.
Consider the identity group action. All elements do nothing.
const(7, x). It would be the rules job to discver that.
If we can prediscover, we should use a subgroup or something

Interestingly for the +n group, an inconsistency needs to be resolved by solving the equation? No.. well...
e1 + 7 = e8 + 2
e1 + 9 = e8 + 4

Combo of negation and addition is group.
e8 + 4 = e8 + 3 ---> 0 = 1
-e8 + 4 = +e8 + 3 ---> 2e8 = 1 . Not solvable over integers. But could be ok

Accidentally ended up being sat next to Leo de Moura at a dinner I was late to. That was a trip. I mostly clammed up (the right move?) but i did briefly poke him to see if he was aghast at the idea of knuckeldragger or egraphs modulo theories / bottom up ematching. He was not aghast but quite rightfully wanted to know what was the application. When the man says you should be using lean to your face, it's very compelling. Lean is an insane steam train. It might change the world.

Met

## Other days

I did a bad job of keeping up these notes

Sat next to Alexander Lew at dinner. Interesting conversation about probalistic types, Dario Stein. Information flow and information security vs parametrcitiy vs hygiene vs multistage programming. Information can only flow one way. "The trick" is indriect information leakage.

The probability of "truth" of a proposition vs probablisty of a proof being found / valid. Probablistic dependent typing.

Leo brought the fire in his Keynote. Why are we all not using lean?
KLR <https://github.com/leanprover/KLR>

Pavel called Knuckledragger the KMart of proof asistants. An interesting branding idea.

Long discussion with Rudi on day 2 trying to understand what slotted egraphs are. They might start from the named perspective. `i + j` is not equal to `x + y` but they are related via renaming. A distinction between renaming, permutations. Maybe 3 kinds of identifiers, canonical identifiers 0,1,2,3 for canonized shapes, x,y,z for user names, and v,w,u for generated eclass slot names. Renamings go between these things. Maybe a groupoid is a nice model of this. Maybe multia-rity keyword only lambdas. That's an interesting twist. I think maybe we agreed the slotted hash-cons made sense. I think in the group union find i had never considered how two things oculd be related by more than one group element. This also occurred in the labelled union find work. The root can store the invariances. `i + j = j + i` is actually a permutation symmettry.

Fancy fancy dinner.

As i was describing co-egraphs <https://www.philipzucker.com/coegraph/> to people I was getting rexcited about it. It feels like a good idea! Zach says that a functional pearl is possible if getting into and out of the egraphs  could be made easier for PEGs. Also streaming languages like streamit

Floating point verification in knuckeldragger. Alex Aiken work on math.h and FPAN maybe as good places to look

Had a very expensive coffee Ganesh bought me. <https://users.cs.utah.edu/~ganesh/> It was a fun chat. He has a really cool seeming textbook on automata in addition to the other stuff he's go going on. <https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ezRWes7OkszARizFBPOqwUUqrGj8h6Q/view?usp=sharing>

Spoke with Mark Moller a bit. I wonder if there could be some kind of useful partnership there if I could get co-egraphs to a more ready to chug point. KAT modulo theories came up. I looked into it again, this seems promising. Yeah, if I bake in sequences or semirings, why not bake in a kleene algebra or KAT? The normal form of kleene algerba expressiom is a bit unclear. Minimized automata are a normal form. Probably they don't play well with general equalities. But KAT modulo theories is kind of about this?

Need a benchmark suite for egraphs. KAT could be one source. Coset enumeration.

Max pointed out that bottom up e-matching can be reconciled with relational ematching if you just brute the database whenever you give up on pruning an intermediate variable. It is ineed the idea of "universes", just very baked into the system. Universes are a nice backup when there is nothing you can do.

Ok to go a little long

Early stoppage of undecidable. Egraph heals incomplete rebuilding

Universe enumeration

Mbqe. Egraph is a model. Hmm. Bottom up really is mbqe, but the domain is not int. Its Int[x]. Dolan said this is right for some reason

Cost functions. Use cost to prune patterns. Yeah, sure

Partial functions as a model of dtt? Then universes can be working better.

Lambda ematching. Single level pattern.

Misaal uses egraphs

Parse egglog.

Max says cartsiean product is maximally dumb coninctovr query. What I did is projecting that a little smarter. Like datalog, there is a maximal substitution set so it becomes possible

Relational model of hoas. In different worlds, different names are used.

Use persistent array to compute union find diffs

Put parametric term in random context / testbench. Like noninterference testbench

Abstract interpretation in knickeldragger. Or lean. Hmm. That sounds fun/useful

Bdd to store inequality info. If var order is close to a topological order, good right?

Knuckle hoare

Interval is proof of shape And(a <= x, x <= b). With sequent precond? Prob.

I say “what if logic was inteinsically stateful” but that kind of is hoare logic. An issue is that the pre post are themselves regilar logic. What if they were hoare again?

`{ {P} C {q} } C {q}`

Its kind of the insight of cbmc. We don’t need another logic

Bdd as an automata that accepts sat models. Huh

Automata equality vs language (minimal aitomata) equality. Capture some computational context

Chebyshev numbers. Work at higher precision then lower. That’s the lanczos thing

Somehow derive a condition that says function composition is as accurate as possible.

Try sample compitations at low precision

Pick truncation not pointwise but to minimize minimax error

Maybe if you’re doing mathematical programming, the bernstein polys are relavant?

For a datasey of problems, one could solve for minimal error diescretization. Maybe there’s an answer for lipshitz bound functions or something.

Dfa for lists. Observations vs recursive components.

Maybe if nominal sets works over a groupoid that cleans freshness up

Kind of like set + set of names model. Carrying free vars. Hmm. Ctx, set(stuff)

No term fumctions like not. Then [x,y] |- x : A is sensible. Type families can still kind of check on terms. And really, bolting in true / false is like having them in context

Nominal as a groupoid

Generic join is quantifier elim

Bdd is quantifier elim for bools.

Hmm existential elimination in query body

“ symbolic” database

Do bdddbdbds with linear constraints. Do it with polynomials?

Fourier mtzkin into grobner bases.

A dsl of datatype declarations using type = .

Cross stage persistence.

All and any should become

i do have enough infrastructure to make match work. Keyword arguments. So maybe () is right

Cosnider enodes are linear. Consider enodes are tome invariant functionals? Some are some arent.

I don’t want to propagate just simple equalities. I want to propagate the least common refinable equivalence realtion describable. Which is often simple equality. This is a generalization of refinement towers

Group union find could take in proof to canon (?). Canon(self, x, prf) because cant fenerate itself?

A group union find for cincrete group. But group union find for finitely generated group is in undecidable.

Interpetation of types as extensible sets. Fun env -> set. bool takes in other variables at play in context. Egraph extended to maintain explicit sets for set vars

Setids take place of Int etc. setids also need to be rebuilt.

I can indeed use z3 exprs as setids. Why not.

We do have a notion of a first class set now? Is that why we’re beyond egglog?

Getting a proof object could be getting the (possibly many) group element connecting.

Definitional equality is on the nose equal union find. Prop is modulo group action or other theory notion.

Long doc strings in kncukeldragger to start towards arip

Is_type, has_type, is_eq

Must_type . Query and assertion forms of all judgements

Union is defeq. Canon and equal is defeq

I guess its kind of a setoid model.

If I use. Lambdax True to represent Int, then lambda egraph has subset relationships.

Brite force egraph is theory. Rebuild propagates. Could collect learned

Using cvc5 as z3 user propagator.

Z3 to pysmt via serialize to smt

Setoid model would map each dependent type to a binary equaivalence relation type = lambda xy. R(x,y). The materialized form of this ought to be  involve a first class union find yeah? Partial setoid

Refinement types are the multisorted to dependent types single sorted. Huh.

Frex

Partial eval of z3.

Term banks and smart constructors in the context of staged metaproframming
