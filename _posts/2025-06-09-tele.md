title: Categorical Substitution Etudes
date: 2025-06-09
---

Examining the categorical formulation of simple substitutions is useful to understand more complex topics.

Simple substitutions form a category.

The objects are ordered lists of sorts representing the variables in contexts `[smt.Int("x"), smt.Real("y"), ...]`.

Substitutions compose and have an identity in a natural way

We give them names to easily reference them. Everything is actually alpha equivalent with respect to the names.
`ts` are expressions like `[cos(x), sin(cos(x))]`. They kind of match a naive notion of "function expression".

You can apply these things to a list of terms and they'll inject those terms into the variable positions.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from kdrag.all import *
@dataclass
class Subst():
    dom : list[smt.ExprRef] # a list of variables
    cod : list[smt.ExprRef] # Kind of redudnant but useful for seeing connection to telescopes
    ts : list[smt.ExprRef] # same length and types as cod, with vars from dom
    def __post_init__(self):
        assert len(self.cod) == len(self.ts)
    def __call__(self, *args : smt.ExprRef) -> list[smt.ExprRef]:
        """ Apply subst to multi term"""
        if len(args) != len(self.dom):
            raise ValueError(f"Expected {len(self.dom)} arguments, got {len(args)}")
        return [smt.substitute(self.ts, *zip(self.dom, args)) for t in self.ts]
    def __matmul__(self, other):
        """Composition plugs other's terms into self's holes"""
        assert isinstance(other, Subst)
        assert len(self.dom) == len(other.cod) and all(v.sort() == w.sort() for v, w in zip(self.dom, other.cod))
        return Subst(other.dom, self.cod, [smt.substitute(t, *zip(self.dom, other.ts)) for t in self.ts])
    @classmethod
    def id_(cls, xs : list[smt.ExprRef]):
        """ identity map does nothing"""
        return Subst(xs, xs, xs)
    def __mul__(self, other : Subst):
        # a monoidal product of substitutions. Doing them in parallel.
        assert isinstance(other, Subst)
        def freshen(xs):
            return [smt.FreshConst(x.sort(),prefix=x.decl().name()) for x in xs]
        odom = freshen(other.dom)
        ocod = freshen(other.cod)
        ots = [smt.substitute(t, *zip(other.dom, odom)) for t in other.ts]
        return Subst(self.dom + odom, self.cod + ocod, self.ts + odom)
    def __eq__(self, other) -> smt.BoolRef:
        """The proposition that two substitutions/morphisms are equal. To be assumed or proven"""
        assert len(self.dom) == len(other.dom) and len(self.cod) == len(other.cod)
        assert all(v.sort() == w.sort() for v, w in zip(self.dom, other.dom))
        assert all(v.sort() == w.sort() for v, w in zip(self.cod, other.cod))
        ots = [smt.substitute(t, *zip(other.dom, self.dom)) for t in other.ts] # rename to common variables self.dom
        return smt.ForAll(self.dom, smt.And([t1 == t2 for (t1,t2) in zip(self.ts, ots)]))


x,y,z = smt.Ints('x y z')
Subst.id_([x]) @ Subst.id_([y])


```

    Subst(dom=[y], cod=[x], ts=[y])

```python
Subst([x], [y,z], [x + 1, x - 2]) @ Subst([x], [y], [x * 7])

```

    Subst(dom=[x], cod=[y, z], ts=[x*7 + 1, x*7 - 2])

```python

Subst.id_([x]) * Subst.id_([y])
```

    Subst(dom=[x, y!7], cod=[x, y!8], ts=[x, y!7])

A sequence of ground terms can be lifted into a subst coming from the empty context. This is a standard categorical trick of pointing out a particular thing by using a map from some unit object.

```python
def lift_ground(*ts) -> Subst:
    return Subst([], [smt.FreshConst(t.sort()) for t in ts], list(ts))
```

Function symbols can be seen as the substitution that would apply them

```python
def lift_funcdecl(f : smt.FuncDeclRef):
    args = [smt.FreshConst(f.domain(n)) for n in range(f.arity())]
    out = [smt.FreshConst(f.range())]
    return Subst(args, out, [f(*args)])

foo = smt.Function("foo", smt.IntSort(), smt.RealSort(), smt.BoolSort())
lift_funcdecl(foo)
```

The is an opposite category of substitutions that instead of applying the `ts` to `args`, narrows the the variables in a predicate P(x) to the ts. Considering the predicate as a morphism from the vars to `[Bool]`, this is reverse composition.

P can also be considered as a Subst to Bool.

```python
def subst(s : Subst, P : smt.ExprRef) -> smt.ExprRef: 
    return smt.substitute(P, zip(s.cod, s.ts))

def lift_pred(vs : list[smt.ExprRef], P : smt.ExprRef) -> Subst:
    """
    Lift a predicate P over variables vs to a substitution.
    """
    return Subst(vs, [smt.FreshConst(P.sort())], [P])

```

What is a unification problem in these terms?

It is useful to extend the notion of a single equation to a multiequation.
Then what we have is two substitutions need to be equal.

```
          - S >  
k - H > m        n
          - T > 
```

For some reason literature seems to describe unification as as coequalizer. I don't understand why. Maybe I'm totally wrong. Or perhaps that are taking the "narrowing" interpretation of substitutions rather than the "applying" interpretation.

See Goguen What is Unification <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780120463701500127?via%3Dihub> <https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/snyder/publications/UnifChapter.pdf>  section 3.3.3

```python
def unify(s : Subst, t : Subst):
    assert len(s.dom) == len(t.dom) and all(v.sort() == w.sort() for v, w in zip(s.dom, t.dom))
    assert len(s.cod) == len(t.cod) and all(v.sort() == w.sort() for v, w in zip(s.cod, t.cod))
    todo = list(zip(s.ts, [smt.substitute(e, *zip(t.dom, s.dom)) for e in t.ts]))
    subst = Subst.id_(s.dom) # null substitution
    while todo:
        (s,t) = todo.pop()
        if s in s.dom: # is var
            newsubst = ...
            subst = subst @ newsubst
        #yada. Not sure it's calirfying to write this in this way
    
```

Equational axioms can be expressions as the commuting squares of certain arrows.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawvere_theory>

Every object is a product of a distinguished object: yes.
Homomorphisms are functors in this context. This is nice tight formulation of homomorphism, although I find the more expanded definition much more intuitive. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism>

```python
add  = Subst([x,y], [z], [x + y])
swap = Subst([x,y], [y,x], [y,x])
kd.prove(add == add @ swap)
```

&#8870;ForAll([x, y], And(x + y == y + x))

## Telescopes

An interesting thing to do is start enriching the notion of object / context / things substitions go from and to.

One formulation of telescopes <https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/type+telescope> for a refinement type looking thing is to pack every variable with a boolean expression describing what preconditions / subset the subtitution is coming from. These are partial substitutions in some sense.

The meaning of a telescope can be somewhat explained by showing how to "forall" a predicate in that context using TForAll. Because of the iterated construction, the earlier variables are in scope for the later variables.

```python
from kdrag.all import *
type Tele = list[tuple[smt.ExprRef, smt.BoolRef]]
def TForAll(vs : Tele, P):
    for v,pre in reversed(vs):
        P = smt.ForAll([v], smt.Implies(pre, P))
    return P

x,y,z = smt.Ints('x y z')
TForAll([(x, x > 0), (y, y > 0)], x + y > 0)

```

&forall;x : x &gt; 0 &rArr; (&forall;y : y &gt; 0 &rArr; x + y &gt; 0)

Telescope mappings are a generalization of substitutions. We can use them to organize a theorem proving process involving pre and post conditions.
They represent a bundling of the previous `Subst` and theorems/proofs about pre and post conditions of the terms in that subst.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
@dataclass
class TeleMap():
    dom : Tele
    cod : Tele
    ts : list[smt.ExprRef]  # len(cod) expression using variables in dom. When dom preconditions are true, cod conditions should hold of ts.
    def __post_init__(self):
        assert len(self.ts) == len(self.cod)
        subst = [(v, t) for (v, _), t in zip(self.cod, self.ts)]
        self.pfs = []
        for (v, cond) in self.cod:
            self.pfs.append(kd.prove(TForAll(self.dom, smt.substitute(cond, *subst))))
    def __call__(self, *args):
        assert len(args) == len(self.dom)
        subst = [(v, a) for (v, _), a in zip(self.dom, args)]
        #for pf in self.pfs:
        for (_, pre) in self.dom:
            kd.prove(smt.substitute(pre, *subst))
        return [smt.substitute(t, *subst) for t in self.ts]
    @classmethod
    def id_(cls, xs : Tele):
        return cls(xs, xs, [v for v, _ in xs])
    def __matmul__(self, other):
        assert len(self.dom) == len(other.cod)
        subst = [(v, w) for (v, _), (w, _) in zip(self.dom, other.cod)]
        ws = [w for w,_ in other.cod]
        vs = [v for v,_ in self.dom]
        for (v, pre), (w, post) in zip(self.dom, other.cod):
            assert v.sort() == w.sort(), f"Sort mismatch: {v.sort()} != {w.sort()}"
            # allows subset composition rather than on the nose composition.
            kd.prove(TForAll(other.cod, smt.substitute(pre, *subst))) 
        return TeleMap(other.dom, self.cod, [smt.substitute(t, *zip(vs, other.ts)) for t in self.ts])

TeleMap([(x, x > -1)],[(y, y > 0)], [x + 1])  @ TeleMap([(x, x > 0)], [(y, y > 0)], [x + 1])
```

    TeleMap(dom=[(x, x > 0)], cod=[(y, y > 0)], ts=[x + 1 + 1])

A well formed telescope mapping represents a theorem about the mappings in the `ts`. If all variables satisfy the preconditions in the `self.dom` telescope, the terms `self.ts` should obey the postconditions in the `self.cod`

```python
TeleMap([(x, x > 0), (z, z > x)], [(y, y > 0), (z, z > 1)], [x + z, z]).pfs
```

    [|- ForAll(x,
            Implies(x > 0, ForAll(z, Implies(z > x, x + z > 0)))),
     |- ForAll(x, Implies(x > 0, ForAll(z, Implies(z > x, z > 1))))]

```python
TeleMap([(x, x > 0)], [(y, y > 0)], [x + 1])(smt.IntVal(7))
```

    [7 + 1]

```python
# fails to meet precondition
TeleMap([(x, x > 0)], [(y, y > 0)], [x + 1])(smt.IntVal(-2))
```

# Bits and Bobbles

While I normalized to `type Tele = list[tuple[smt.ExprRef, smt.BoolRef]]` there is also a reasonable versions of `Tele` that hold `smt.Lambda([x], pre)` in that second position. This makes it look more like typical dependent typees. For example, I can define `Pos = smt.Lambda([x], x > 0)` and have a telescope `[(x, Pos)]` instead of `[(x, Pos(x))]`. The forms are basically interconvertible but they make the mind go different places.

This is approximately the subset model of dependent type theory?

One could take all variables to be in a `DeclareSort("PreTerm")` sort and then the subsets really do take care of the things the z3 simple sort system is doing for us. This is more flexible, but pushing more into runtime/solvetime / deeper encoding depth.

SMTLIB is a functional programming language kind of. Refinement/liquid/subset typing applied to it is perfectly reasonable and pleasingly homoiconic.
Maybe using spacer to discharge them could be kind of clever.

Telescope unification?

The equalizer in a lawvere theory is E-unification.

coalgebra.
a -> f a

operads are term rewriting equations with linearity on the rules

Hmm. I'm using smt.substitute which is simultaneous substitution. Since my semantics is nested forall, I should be used iterated substutition?

It really seems like I have defined the opposite category to the one they want.

Subobjects are modelled as mappings into an object that are injective.

Hmm. Maybe explicit cod was a mistake. I dunno.

I am puzzled about whether there is really that much utility of the telescope form `forall x, p(x) => forall y, q(x,y) => ...` vs just the smashed together version `forall x y ..., p(x) /\ q(x,y) /\ ...`. The latter is more reminiscent of Isabelle Pure.

    return frozenset({(x, ()) for x in A if P(x)}) # Note because of pythion truthiness, this also accepts ordinary bool value predicates.

```

We can also make a subset model as mentioned here <https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/HofmannExtensionalIntensionalTypeTheory.pdf>

Types are interpreted as a pair of a frozenset and a callable function representing the subset orf that frozenset

There are now two equalities to talk about. On the nose equality `==` and kleene equality

TRUE = lambda: True
FALSE = lambda: False

Void = (frozenset({}), TRUE)

Bool = (frozenset({True, False}), TRUE)
def Fin(n : int) -> Type:
    return (frozenset(range(n)), TRUE)

Hmm. Coequalizer?

Hmm. Yes the variables in the terms are associated with the CODOMINA of the subtitution.
The domain of the substitution is a mere indexing basically and almost doesn't have a sense of being a variable.

To be comparing vars in codomain like unification, it should be aa coequalizer

{x -> f(x', y'), y -> g(x', y')}
[f(v0,v1), g(v0,v1)]

[f(p(q(a)))] is a concrete ground term. The codomain is implicit. It could be 0 vars (?)
The domain is 1.

A signature can be expressed as noting atomic elements [f(v0,v1)]  [g(v0)]. [mul(v0,v1)] [inv(v0)] []

A particular open preciate is [even(succ(succ(v0)))]  a multi predicate is interpreted as conjunction?

Raising nad lowering unneccesary variables.
Projecting out variables as exists and forall
duplicating variables ~ eq

[v0, v0]  expsress {x -> x', y -> x'}  a merging substitution
There is no duplicating susbtitution. {x -> x', x -> y'}

vBool -> F(x)  . vInt -> succ(y) = vBool -> F(succ(y))
post composition is substituion into predicate
vBool -> F(x)  . vInt -> add(z,y) = vBool -> F(add(x,y)) this makes morew vairblwes.

f(x,y) = x   is and equation saying the vInt -> f(x,y) is the same as raise(vInt -> x, vInt)

Typing as fibers.
gamma |- A  is like a (entangled) product of gamma and A

proj(gamma |- A) = gamma

The functoriality of substutuition to the predicate category is saying that if you prove and implication with variables in it, you can substute in anything you want and still have a proof.
No. predicates have to be over the same context to be compared...
gamma |- A -> B
No wait. If we include a subst we have a way to compare the two variable sets...

There is a category over a single ctx.
The is also a category of ctx maps

Apropos partial functions: the thing that Nate and I talked about a bit was modeling these as spans, So a partial function f:A-> B would be a pair of regular functions g:X->A, h:X->B, where h is monic, and f(a) = b would translate to Ex.g(x) = a and h(x) = b. If you make h epic, that corresponds to the function being total, and if you relax the constraint that h is monic, you get what feel like multiset valued functions. For encoding in a theorem prover, I wonder if it would be smoother to use cospans, so g:A->X, h:B->X, with h monic. Then f(a) = b could translate to g(a) = f(b), and you don't need the quantifier. X could be basically Maybe B.

From lunch: sorry, coequalizer, not equalizer
About the substitution thing: the inclusion function, from the set of definable sets of individuals (represented by one-variable formulas/predicates) to the set of definable sets of pairs of individuals (represented by two-variable formulas) is actually the result of a substitution, if you look at it a certain way. Suppose I have a two-argument function, f(x,y) and a one variable formula F(x). I can make a two variable formula by substitution: F(f(x,y)). If my function is projection of the left argument, so that f(x,y) = x, then what my substitution is doing is, in a more explicit way, turning F from a one variable formula into a slightly degenerate case of a two variable formula.

There's a contravariant functor thing going on here: f : A -> B induces a functor from the fiber (in this case, a Boolean algebra of definable sets or something) over B to the fiber over A.


Yea, coequalizer does seem right now
What is the fiber? There is a special Bool object maybe and  strangely the morphisms coming out of bool represent predicates and the target object is the vars in the predicate expression?
Or it the boolean algebra a category connected to our substitution category by a functor, ie a model of our signature

So, the boolean algebra is the fiber. The objects in there are equivalence classes of formulas, and the arrows are the boolean algebra ordering, which corresponds to implication.

The idea is that there's a total category whose objects are formulas in a typing context. So, like a "two variable formula" is a formula whose variables are a subset of x,y, in a context "x: individual, y: individual". The contexts are the base category, and the functor that erases formulas and just leaves the context is the fibration. The fibers are the preimage categories of a given context plus its identity map - in the FOL case, these turn out to be Boolean algebras. (edited) 

The contexts are the objects in the base category of substitutions or each context is an entire base category? (edited) 


They're objects in a base category. Base category is not quite a category of substitutions, it's more like a category where the maps are function symbols. So like, a two variable function f induces a map from the context "x: individual, y: individual" to "x:individual". But a map in the base category like this creates a map (going in the other direction) between the fibers, which is essentially the result of substituting f(x,y) for x in each of the formulas-in-context in the fiber, thereby changing the context that it lives in.


What about if you compose two maps? Isn’t it then not a function symbol and something more structured, more like a general substitution? Its generated by the function symbols ?

Yeah, that's right.
I'd think of it as a term, so like f(g(x,z),y) might be a map from the context x,y,z to the context x.



Something I was realizing last night is substitution goes the other way. x,y,z is the codomain, despite how weird that feels
{x’ -> f(g(x,z),y)}
makes that feel better. Those codomain vars are on the right now

All is well with the world.

Are the upper objects full equivalence classes? Seems like a burden. Why can’t the upper objects be individual predicate expressions, what is the set getting us?

I think they can. It just wouldn't be a boolean algebra anymore.

a = b = c, why can’t an object be {a,b}

# refeinment sorts

I had notes somewhere about prolog using CLP.

<https://noamz.org/oplss16/refinements-notes.pdf>

<https://proofassistants.stackexchange.com/questions/755/whats-the-relationship-between-refinement-types-and-dependent-types> hmm. Pierre-Marie suggest that a insifficiently restricted P in {x | P} can effectively enocde full dependent types. "realizability interpetation" in PRL.

Does this subsyetms make me closer to cody's Boole?

smtlib is basically a simply type programming language. Why not

For using new logics in knuckeldragger we can:
deep embed in z3
shallow embed into z3
make new judgement forms at the python metalevel that contain kd.Proof.

annotate will be an immediate call to check (?). So annotate will take in Gamma.

reflection could be an axiom schema to convert HasType to a kd.Proof. Interesting.
