```bash
%%bash
# download and install CBMC

Whenever I'm tinkering around in C, I would love for some easy way to check my work. There is a variety of options (turn on all warnings, inbuilt compiler [static analyzers](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/04/12/state-static-analysis-gcc-12-compiler#a_taint_mode_for_c), sanitizers ([address](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html), thread, cfi), [infer](https://fbinfer.com/), going hardcore interactive theorem prover mode), but an undersung one is using automatic static verifiers.

I'm very impressed by the [Software Verification Competition](https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/) style solvers, in particular [CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc) ([Documentation](https://diffblue.github.io/cbmc//index.html)).

I thought CBMC might be defunct, since it's [main webpage](https://www.cprover.org/cbmc/) does not show recent development, but actually the [github repo](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc) is very active. It appears Amazon is investing in it's usage with a number of significant C projects having CBMC based specs ad verification.

It's pretty easy to install and use. Just get a release from the [github repo](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc/releases) (the one in apt is rather stale)

Here's a basic example:

Obviously the following program will fail the assert



```python
%%file /tmp/ex1.c
#include <assert.h>
int main(){
    assert(1 == 0);
}
```

    Writing /tmp/ex1.c


It's normal code. I can compiler and run it and the assertion triggers.


```python
! gcc /tmp/ex1.c -o /tmp/ex1 && /tmp/ex1
```

    ex1: /tmp/ex1.c:3: main: Assertion `1 == 0' failed.


But I can also run the source through cbmc 


```python
! cbmc /tmp/ex1.c
```

We can also compile this program. It runs just fine.


```python
! gcc /tmp/ex2.c -o /tmp/ex2 && /tmp/ex2
```

CBMC however runs all possible executions, discovering an erroring value the uninitialized variable could take on. We can also track the execution line by line with the `--trace` option

If we put this assertion inside a guarding if, it is no longer possible to trigger the assertion.


```python
%%file /tmp/ex3.c

            assert(x != 12345);

Here is a simple functional correctness example. We can write a `myabs` function and ask if indeed the result is always positive.


```python
%%file /tmp/test.c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int64_t myabs(int64_t x){
    return x <= 0 ? -x : x;
}

int64_t nondet_int();

int main(){
    int64_t x = nondet_int();
    int64_t y = myabs(x);
    assert(y >= 0);
}
```

Say whaaaaaaa????
Oh yeah. Going through the trace see it picked negative maxint. In two's complement, there is one more negative number available than positive number. So it is not clear to me what the compiler should do here actually. I would guess it is allowed to do anything.


Here is something you are more likely to care about, checking for common memory bugs like buffer overflows, etc


```python
%%file /tmp/buffer.c
int main(){
    char buffer[10];
    buffer[10] = 0;
}
```

    Writing /tmp/buffer.c

Whaaaaa!? Where's the bug?!

Yeah, CBMC requires flags to turn on these default checks, for better or worse. I kind of wish there was a do eveything flag, but to my knowledge there isn't. Here is a pile of possibly useful bugs to look for.

# Next Time

I think that's enough for today, but we've only scratched the surface.
But to whet some appetite, here's some uneditted bits about loops and comparative checking.


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AUsNTNq0dbY?si=zfELEKMDjHjIytVZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>



## Loops

Ok, we've painted a rosy picture so far. Obviously CBMC does not scale to arbitrarily large and difficult problems

The basic technique is to uniwind them. All is not lost, many loops (for loops in particular) can be completelyb unwound. You can add `--unwinding-assertions` to know if you've covered all possible executions. Ever if you can't, passing these chekcs does give you some confidence.

If you're going to the next level there is also the ability to add invariant annotations. I'm not sure if CBMC can infer these successfully

On bigger problems, I've had some success fiddling with the 

## Comparative Checking

Comparative checking of programs can be useful for reducing both the specification and verification burden.
In addition, there are some relational properties ("hyperproperties") that require talking about two different runs of a program. The canonical example is information security. If you run two programs with identical low security parts of the states, they must end with identical low security parts of the state. This is true if there is only influence or information transferral going from low to high.

- Translation validation
- Refinement
- Security properties
- Bug fixing

The simplest approach to doing comparative verification so is to use the more commonly available single program verifier on the "product program".

```bash
echo '
#include <assert.h>
int safeprog(int low, int high){
    int foo = low ^ high;
    foo = ((foo << 1) ^ high) >> 1;
    return foo;
}

int main(){
    int high = nondet_int();
    int high1 = nondet_int();
    int low = nondet_int();
    //int high, high1, low;

    __ESBMC_assert(safeprog(low,high) == safeprog(low,high1), "information security property");
    return 0;
}
' > /tmp/test.c
esbmc /tmp/test.c
```

There are many bits of software out there that have security vulnerabilities.

Obviously, the easiest and most likely solution is to change the code in source, recompile, and push out the new version.
This is not always possible or desirable however.

- Even recompiling the original program may introduce bugs due to compiler difference versions
- You may not have the source
-

It is in general an interesting problem to consdier the 50 year software stack.

Worse is better: A use case for dumb compilers


# Bits and Bobbles

Here's a list of serious C projects with CBMC instrumentation, many from Amazon: https://model-checking.github.io/cbmc-training/projects.html. They are playing a similar role to unit tests for library functions.

SV Comp  https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/ - CPAchecker UAutomizer are very successful in the competition. I have not used them as much

Klee, symcc are symbolic executors. Similar in many respects to a bounded model checker. I think the biggest philosophical difference is they aren't really centered around ensuring bug absence, instead around bug finding, which is a little different.

    without parentheses, quotes or even commas for convenience.  Line magics take a
    single % and cell magics are prefixed with two %%.
    
    Example magic function calls:
    
    %alias d ls -F   : 'd' is now an alias for 'ls -F'
    alias d ls -F    : Works if 'alias' not a python name
    alist = %alias   : Get list of aliases to 'alist'
    cd /usr/share    : Obvious. cd -<tab> to choose from visited dirs.
    %cd??            : See help AND source for magic %cd
    %timeit x=10     : time the 'x=10' statement with high precision.
    %%timeit x=2**100
    x**100           : time 'x**100' with a setup of 'x=2**100'; setup code is not
                       counted.  This is an example of a cell magic.
    
    System commands:
    
    !cp a.txt b/     : System command escape, calls os.system()
    cp a.txt b/      : after %rehashx, most system commands work without !
    cp ${f}.txt $bar : Variable expansion in magics and system commands
    files = !ls /usr : Capture system command output
    files.s, files.l, files.n: "a b c", ['a','b','c'], 'a\nb\nc'
    
    History:
    
    _i, _ii, _iii    : Previous, next previous, next next previous input
    _i4, _ih[2:5]    : Input history line 4, lines 2-4
    exec(_i81)       : Execute input history line #81 again
    %rep 81          : Edit input history line #81
    _, __, ___       : previous, next previous, next next previous output
    _dh              : Directory history
    _oh              : Output history
    %hist            : Command history of current session.
    %hist -g foo     : Search command history of (almost) all sessions for 'foo'.
    %hist -g         : Command history of (almost) all sessions.
    %hist 1/2-8      : Command history containing lines 2-8 of session 1.
    %hist 1/ ~2/     : Command history of session 1 and 2 sessions before current.
    %hist ~8/1-~6/5  : Command history from line 1 of 8 sessions ago to
                       line 5 of 6 sessions ago.
    %edit 0/         : Open editor to execute code with history of current session.
    
    Autocall:
    
    f 1,2            : f(1,2)  # Off by default, enable with %autocall magic.
    /f 1,2           : f(1,2) (forced autoparen)
    ,f 1 2           : f("1","2")
    ;f 1 2           : f("1 2")
    
    Remember: TAB completion works in many contexts, not just file names
    or python names.
