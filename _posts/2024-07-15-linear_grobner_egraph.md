title: "Gauss and Groebner Egraphs: Intrinsic Linear and Polynomial Equations"
date: 2024-07-15

It is a paradoxical bummer that associativity and commutativity are two hard to orient rules (the point of the egraph approach) but also highly explosive for what feels like administrative manipulations.

In particular, associativity and commutativity are properties of multiplication and addition of familiar ordinary numbers.

Linear and polynomials expressions have pretty good special methods for them. Using general term rewriting or egraph techniques to solve linear equations feels like insanity.

Humanity is so good at linear equations. It's kind of one of the few mathematical things we can do at scale. So, is there an intrinsic way of bolting linear equality and polynomial equality reasoning into egraph equality saturation?

Yeah, I think so.

In short, replace the union find by reduced row echelon form / groebner basis and use bottom up e-matching.

## What are Union Finds?

Union finds "solve" equations of the form `x0 = x1, x1 = x2, x1 = x2, x3 = x4`

A union find is a forest of equivalence classes. Each tree in the forest is one equivalence class. The children point up to the parents for a fast `find` operation to get a canonical member (the root) of each eq class.

This might result in a union find that looks like

`x0 -> x2`

`x1 -> x2`

`x3 -> x4`

```python
from graphviz import Digraph


dot = Digraph()

uf = [("x0", "x2"), ("x1", "x2"), ("x3", "x4")]
for edge in uf:
    dot.edge(edge[0], edge[1])
dot
```

## Linear Algebra and Unions Finds

These equations can also be interpreted as a linear equations though.

We can rewrite the simple equations `x0 = x2` as `x0 - x2 = 0`. This can be seen as dot product `(1 0 -1 ...) . (x0 x1 x2 ...) = 0`

When we have multiple equations, these each become a row in a constraint matrix `Ax = 0`.

For example, the equations `x0 = x1, x1 = x2, x1 = x2, x3 = x4` becomes the rows of the matrix A

```python
import sympy as sp
A =   sp.Matrix([
    [1,-1, 0,0, 0],  # x0 = x1
    [0, 1,-1,0, 0],  # x1 = x2
    [0, 1, -1, 0,0], # x1 = x2
    [0, 0, 0,1,-1],  # x3 = x4
   # [0, 1, 0,0,-1],
    ])
sp.pprint(A)

```

    ⎡1  -1  0   0  0 ⎤
    ⎢                ⎥
    ⎢0  1   -1  0  0 ⎥
    ⎢                ⎥
    ⎢0  1   -1  0  0 ⎥
    ⎢                ⎥
    ⎣0  0   0   1  -1⎦

We can get the reduced row echelon form. This is using row additions to turn the leading coefficients to 1 and clear out that coefficient from the lower rows.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_echelon_form>

```python
# reduced row echelon form
sp.pprint(A.rref()[0])
```

    ⎡1  0  -1  0  0 ⎤
    ⎢               ⎥
    ⎢0  1  -1  0  0 ⎥
    ⎢               ⎥
    ⎢0  0  0   1  -1⎥
    ⎢               ⎥
    ⎣0  0  0   0  0 ⎦

 The row echelon form gives us a notion of normalizing a linear expression.

Each nonzero row of this matrix can be interpreted as a normalizing rewrite system.
`x0 -> x2`
`x1 -> x2`
`x3 -> x4`

Such a rewrite system can also be seen as a forest of equivalence classes, aka the union find. The rhs are the roots of the tree and the lhs are the children of the roots.

But of course, we don't have to use the simple equations a union find already supports. We can assert any linear combination of variables is equal to another linear combo. And we can still use reduced row echelon form to normalize / find a canonical form of a linear expression given these equational constraints. It appears that we can basically slide these matrix operations right into the egraph, replacing the union find as a generalization.

Any linear expression we write down can be put into a canonical form by running these rules. I'm not exactly sure how to express this elegantly in linear algebraic language, but it is obviously imperatively doable. Take your input vector, go down each row and use it to replace that column. This is similar to inverting? Let's just move on to groebner bases where it's more obvious.

As an alternative motivation for the connection between union finds and linear algebra, note that union finds are useful for finding connected components in a graph. Adjacency matrices are also an encoding of the graph and connected component (or interestingly approximate connected component) information can be extracted via linear algebraic or spectral means. So there is similar junk in there.

## Gaussian Elimination and Groebner Bases

It turns out that it will be easiest to immediately use the generalization of these considerations, [Groebner bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6bner_basis). This is a good tutorial <https://mattpap.github.io/masters-thesis/html/src/groebner.html>

Groebner bases are a canonical form for a set of multinomial equations with good behavior with respect to polynomial division.

This directly generalizes the reduced row echelon form above. The grobner basis for linear polynomials `x0 - x1 = 0` etc will be in exactly the same form as the reduced row echelon form.

```python
import sympy as sp
xs = sp.symbols('x0 x1 x2 x3 x4')
x0, x1, x2, x3, x4 = xs
eqs = [
    x0 - x1,
    x1 - x2,
    x1 - x2,
    x3 - x4,
]
G = sp.groebner(eqs, xs, order='lex')
G
```

$\displaystyle \operatorname{GroebnerBasis}\left(\left( x_{0} - x_{2}, \  x_{1} - x_{2}, \  x_{3} - x_{4}\right), \left( x_{0}, \  x_{1}, \  x_{2}, \  x_{3}, \  x_{4}\right)\right)$

When we have a grobner basis in hand, we can reduced a polynomial expression to a canonical form via a process of multinomial division. `sympy` implements this is [`sympy.reduced`](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/polys/reference.html#sympy.polys.polytools.reduced)

Here we see `x0` reduces to the canonical `x2`, the same as the above union find.

```python
# The first is coefficients of the grobner basis, the second is the remainder aka canonical terms
sp.reduced(x0, G) 
```

    ([1, 0, 0], x2)

More examples of canonical forms coming from this system

```python
print(f"{sp.reduced(x0, G)=}")
print(f"{sp.reduced(x1, G)=}")
print(f"{sp.reduced(x2, G)=}")
print(f"{sp.reduced(x3, G)=}")
print(f"{sp.reduced(x4, G)=}")
print(f"{sp.reduced(x0+2*x2 + 17*x3, G)=}")
print(f"{sp.reduced(3*x0 + 25*x4 - 8*x3, G)=}") # another way of writing same linear combination under these assumptions
```

    sp.reduced(x0, G)=([1, 0, 0], x2)
    sp.reduced(x1, G)=([0, 1, 0], x2)
    sp.reduced(x2, G)=([0, 0, 0], x2)
    sp.reduced(x3, G)=([0, 0, 1], x4)
    sp.reduced(x4, G)=([0, 0, 0], x4)
    sp.reduced(x0+2*x2 + 17*x3, G)=([1, 0, 17], 3*x2 + 17*x4)
    sp.reduced(3*x0 + 25*x4 - 8*x3, G)=([3, 0, -8], 3*x2 + 17*x4)

# Egraphing it

Ok, an egraph is basically some kind of node table associating eclasses to enodes + a union find.

We will use sympy symbols `ei` to represent our eclasses and the stock sympy groebner basis routines to do the union find action. The point of the union find is you can add new equalities and you can normalize an eclass by calling find.

| Atomic Eq  | Linear Eq | Poly Eq  |
|------------|----------|----------|
| union find | Row Echelon | Grobner  Basis  |
| union      | Gaussian Elim | Buchberger Algo |
| union      | add row | add eq     |
| find       | zero out vec ~ invert | reduce/poly divide/remainder |

Curiously and interestingly now, you can multiply and add eclasses.

Rebuild is just congruence closure and sympy's buchberger grobner basis discovery smashed together in a fixed point loop.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
EClass = sp.Symbol
ENode = tuple[str,...]
# helper functions to turn integers into sympy symbols
def sympy_eclass(n):
    return sp.symbols('e' + str(n))
def eclass_of_sympy(eclass):
    return int(eclass.name[1:])

@dataclass
class EGraph:
    poly_eqs : list[sp.Expr]
    hashcons : dict[ENode, EClass]
    eclasses : list[EClass]
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.poly_eqs = []
        self.hashcons : Dict[ENode, EClass] = {}
        self.eclasses = []
    def find(self, x : EClass) -> EClass:
        return sp.reduced(x, self.poly_eqs, self.eclasses)[1]
    def union(self, x : EClass,y : EClass) -> EClass:
        x = self.find(x)
        y = self.find(y)
        if x != y:
            self.poly_eqs.append(x - y)
    def makeset(self):
        x = sympy_eclass(len(self.eclasses))
        self.eclasses.append(x)
        return x
    def make(self, t : ENode) -> EClass:
        t1 = self.hashcons.get(t)
        if t1 == None:
            v = self.makeset()
            self.hashcons[t] = v
            return v
        else:
            return t1
    def rebuild(self):
        # simple naive dumb rebuild step. Could be optimized significantly
        while True:
            #rebuild "union find", buchberhe
            self.poly_eqs = list(sp.groebner(self.poly_eqs, *self.eclasses))

            # rebuild hashcons"
            newhashcons = {}
            for k,v in self.hashcons.items():
                (f,*args) = k
                args = map(self.find,args) # normalize argument eclasses
                enode = (f,*args)
                eclass = self.hashcons.get(enode)
                if eclass != None:
                    self.union(v,eclass)
                newhashcons[enode] = self.find(v)
            if self.hashcons == newhashcons: # reached fixed point
                return
            self.hashcons = newhashcons   
    def add_term(self, t):
        if isinstance(t, sp.Expr): # allow partial terms that contain eclasses
            return t
        f, *args = t
        args = map(self.add_term,args)
        return self.make_enode((f,*args))
    def check_term(self, t):
        if isinstance(t, sp.Expr): # allow partial terms that contain eclasses
            return t
        f, *args = t
        map(self.check_term,args)
        return (f,*args)
    def make_enode(self, enode):
        eclass = self.hashcons.get(enode)
        if eclass == None:
            eclass = self.makeset() 
            self.hashcons[enode] = eclass
        return eclass

```

Fooling around a little with a toy egraph example. We can do algebra on eclasses because they are sympy variables. Here I assert $bar^2 = foo(foo(bar))$

```python
E = EGraph()
foobar = E.add_term(("foo", ("foo", ("bar",))))
bar = E.add_term(("bar",))
print(E)
E.union(foobar, bar)
E.rebuild()
print(E)
E.union(bar*bar, foobar)
E.rebuild()
print(E)

```

    EGraph(poly_eqs=[], hashcons={('bar',): e0, ('foo', e0): e1, ('foo', e1): e2}, eclasses=[e0, e1, e2])
    EGraph(poly_eqs=[e0 - e2], hashcons={('bar',): e2, ('foo', e2): e1, ('foo', e1): e2}, eclasses=[e0, e1, e2])
    EGraph(poly_eqs=[e0 - e2, e2**2 - e2], hashcons={('bar',): e2, ('foo', e2): e1, ('foo', e1): e2}, eclasses=[e0, e1, e2])

Here's an example asserting $\sin(bar)^2 + \cos(bar)^2 = 1$ and $bar = biz$, which simplifies $\sin(bar)^2 + \cos(biz)^2$

```python
E = EGraph()
sinbar = E.add_term(("sin", ("bar",)))
cosbiz = E.add_term(("cos", ("biz",)))
cosbar = E.add_term(("cos", ("bar",)))
t1 = E.add_term(sinbar*sinbar + cosbiz*cosbiz)
t2 = E.add_term(sinbar*sinbar + cosbar*cosbar)
print(E)
print(f"sin(bar)**2 + cos(bar)**2 == {t2}")
E.union(t2, 1)
E.rebuild()
print(E)
bar = E.add_term(("bar",))
biz = E.add_term(("biz",))
E.union(biz,bar)
E.rebuild()
print(E)
```

    EGraph(poly_eqs=[], hashcons={('bar',): e0, ('sin', e0): e1, ('biz',): e2, ('cos', e2): e3, ('cos', e0): e4}, eclasses=[e0, e1, e2, e3, e4])
    sin(bar)**2 + cos(bar)**2 == e1**2 + e4**2
    EGraph(poly_eqs=[e1**2 + e4**2 - 1], hashcons={('bar',): e0, ('sin', e0): e1, ('biz',): e2, ('cos', e2): e3, ('cos', e0): e4}, eclasses=[e0, e1, e2, e3, e4])
    EGraph(poly_eqs=[e0 - e2, e1**2 + e4**2 - 1, e3 - e4], hashcons={('bar',): e2, ('sin', e2): e1, ('biz',): e2, ('cos', e2): e4}, eclasses=[e0, e1, e2, e3, e4])

## Bottom Up E-matching

<https://www.philipzucker.com/bottom_up/>

Again, I think bottom up ematching is the way to go when you need to integrate theories into egraph rewriting. Bottom up e-matching guesses what goes into the pattern variables. You can maintain some explicit set of variable guess terms (every term you've explicitly mentioned previously) or similarly just throw in all the eclasses. Then you can normalize them with respect to the egraph and permit the rule to fire if the lhs falls in some heuristic set. The set is commonly the set of terms held in the egraph. Here I just always allow the rule to fire. This is probably more eager than you'd like.

Which linear combinations you should initiate the variables with is not obvious and there is an infinite number of choices. At least naively speaking, it seems you're screwed in terms of completeness. E-graph rewriting was never complete. This is pragmatic mix of what seems readily at hand and doable. Completeness is overrated, but also it feels like complete methods are the only ones that survive, since everyone has their own preferred heuristics. Me dunno.

```python
import itertools
def rw(self, n, f):
    for eclasses in itertools.product(self.eclasses, repeat=n):
        lhs, rhs = f(*eclasses)
        # whatever
        lhs = self.add_term(lhs)
        rhs = self.add_term(rhs)
        self.union(lhs, rhs)
EGraph.rw = rw
```

```python
E = EGraph()
foobar = E.add_term(("foo", ("foo", ("bar",))))
print(E)
#E.rw(1, lambda x: (("foo", x), x))
E.rw(1, lambda x: (("foo", x), 2*x))
#E.rw(1, lambda x: (("foo", 2*x), x))
print(E)
E.rebuild()
E
```

    EGraph(poly_eqs=[], hashcons={('bar',): e0, ('foo', e0): e1, ('foo', e1): e2}, eclasses=[e0, e1, e2])
    EGraph(poly_eqs=[-2*e0 + e1, -2*e1 + e2, -2*e2 + e3], hashcons={('bar',): e0, ('foo', e0): e1, ('foo', e1): e2, ('foo', e2): e3}, eclasses=[e0, e1, e2, e3])





    EGraph(poly_eqs=[8*e0 - e3, 4*e1 - e3, 2*e2 - e3], hashcons={('bar',): e3/8, ('foo', e3/8): e3/4, ('foo', e3/4): e3/2, ('foo', e3/2): e3}, eclasses=[e0, e1, e2, e3])

# Bits and Bobbles

Fully normalizing the to the grobner basis may be overkill. It tends to be a property of egraphs that they are self healing in the face of incomplete canonicalization / hash consing. They can recover later. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu%27s_method_of_characteristic_set> My impression of Wu's method is that it very successful but slightly more ad hoc method for doing geometric theorem proving while still using the same basic idea of polynomial division that grobner bases do.

I pointed out specifically the linear subcase gauss egraph of the grobner egraph because this is probably going to be more tractable at scale.

lex monomial ordering is typically not the best performing one to my understanding. It is the easiest to interpret though. I think other orders ought to work fine.

There was this idea of "symbolic" lattices in egglog. If we defined a lattice using egraph equations for join the "merge" annotation for the table could refer to this insitead of to a primitive lattice like i64-min.

Semiring semantics. Is this getting close to an interesting intertwined notion of semiring semantics? Instead of an a priori quotient ring we could discover what ring we're in and normalize all truth valuers via the grobner. Hmm.

A represntation that is "off by 1" from the above is polynomials as just another kind of container. Containers have a theory specific notion of rebuilding. Sets for example deduplicate and sort on rebuilding (they may have discovered new equations, so sets could shrink). Polynomials are just another container for eclasses. Enodes are just an ordered fixed size array container. <https://www.philipzucker.com/bottom_up/>

"Proof producing" row echelon form is working with the augmented matrix (stacking on an identity matrix) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_matrix>. `E * [R | I] = [E*R | E] = S`. There was something similar you can do for groebner bases I mentioned here. <https://www.philipzucker.com/computing-syzygy-modules-in-sympy/> extra variables to track how you derived the grobner basis from your original equations. One new variable per equation `f`. I barely understand what I'm talking about here. A lesson for the future to write better? Or just evidence my mind changes.

I basically never implement extraction. Does anything fishy happen? I don't think so.

What is the commutative algerba perspective on this? Perhaps we are working in a polynomial ring with compound generators like `x0,x1, foo(x1), foo(x0)`. We now can also normalize the compound generators with respect to the current grobner basis, notice congruence closure equalities, add them in and loop until fixed point. Again, not very mathy sounding. What about `foo(x1 + x0)`? The picked generator set is somewhat similar to my T set of searchable eclasses.

maybe there is a way to bootstrap off of the sympy simplify rules like I could off of z3's. I'm not actually sure I have to opaquify to sympy in the from of the `ei`. Maybe sympy is happy doing groebner bases over compound terms? Then I could take the GRS strategy. This is the analog of what I did for z3 here <https://www.philipzucker.com/ext_z3_egraph/>
I have noticed in the past it is quite hard to stop sympy from doing simplification when you construct terms. `evaluate=False` didn't seem like a panacea

Another interesting thing sympy can do for us is factor polynomials. Could throw that in the mix. We could increase our searchable term set to include factors

```python
# yeah, seems like I didn't need the node table. I could just use sympy terms.
# but ultimately I want to also bolt in other stuff?
foo = sp.Function("foo")
bar = sp.Function("bar")
biz = sp.Function("biz")
eq = [foo(bar()) - bar()]
print(sp.reduced(foo(bar()), eq))
print(sp.reduced(bar(), eq))
e1,e2 = sp.symbols("e1 e2")
eq = [e1 - e2, foo(e1) - e2, bar() - e1]
print(sp.reduced(e2, eq))

print(sp.groebner(eq)) #nice

# ok but it doesn't do inner stuff, so we shouyld traverse manually.
print(sp.reduced(foo(biz()), [bar() - biz()]))
print(sp.reduced(foo(bar()), [bar() - biz()]))


```

    ([-1], foo(bar()))

Quine Mclusky <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm> might be a good replacement for grobner in boolean theories. Not sure what it is though

If you leaned into the gauss version, these matrices are going to be extremely sparse. You may want to use a union find when you don't need linear combinations and only use the matrix methods when you do.

Faster grobner. msolve <https://msolve.lip6.fr/> . singular

Intermixing with non real valued teories. No problem. Use regular union find for those sorts.

Linear inequalities seem to fit better into egraph modulo theories just mirroring into an smt solver for guards. <https://www.philipzucker.com/ext_z3_egraph/>

graver basis for integer linear <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graver_basis> . simple two monomial equations.

The Shostak method to the best I understand it is combining theories by using the theories to eliminate variables rather than just propagate equations.
Linear arithemtic knows how to isolate variables. Sweet. Do that, assert that variable to the egraph. There are piles of papers on shostak's method. Decrypting them is a project on its own. One wonders what the point of writing is when reading is so hard. I dunno. All these theory papers don't illuminate for my taste really. I seek a mall intuitive kernel, like a sentence or two, some hokey pseudo code.

A "soft egraph" which tries to take low rank views?
eivenvectors
could use svd or qr?

That x - y kiund of looks like a finite difference, anything to do with that? homology, homotopty, equality, ideations. Encoding higher equalities linear using mesh curl stuff?

Can we make any sense of an occurs check in this linear form? Unification?

## Egraphs are Ground Completion, Grobner is Knuth Bendix

Gaussian elimination and grobner bases are more like E-ground completion (ground completion in a background theory E). The "variables" appearing in these equations are really 0-arity constants, not variables in the sense of term rewriting. This may help explain why they are terminating, akin to how ground completion is terminating.

Ground completion modulo just associativity is not terminating though, since it is just string rewriting. A funny world

I'll note that associativity added into ground equations makes knuth bendix completion undecidable.

Adding in enough ring equations to bring us back

It's complicated.

If you do this process with some arbitrary collection of polynomials, you can still do it, it is just not guaranteed to be unique.

If this canonical form is 0, then we know that the set of polynomial equational constraints imply the target expression is always zero. If it's nonzero, well, that is just a canonical expression with respect to that groebner basis.

It is this canonicalization property which let's us generalize

What are they for? Well, one use case is to find the [connected components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory)) in an undirected graph. This is used as part of Kruskal's algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm> for finding minimum spanning forests of a graph. You consider the edges in weight order greedily and add it to the spanning tree if it doesn't connect two thing already connected. The union find gives a fast check for already connected.

The "proof" that two edges are connected is the path between them.

There are other approaches though. You might

One way of representing graphs that is very fruitful is the perspective of adjacency matrices <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix> . Multiplication of the matrices can correspond to taking steps or finding paths in the graph. Using min-plus arithemtic, you can find the mininum cost path in this way

A different, kind of crazy, way of finding connected components of a graph might be spectral method. You could take the eigenvectors of the graph laplacian. There ought to be one . So the linear algebraic

I'm not saying any of these considerations directly apply in what we're doing here, but I am noting that linear algebra methods and union finds are in the same ball park.

If you only assert equations of the form `x - y = 0` aka have rows in your matrix of only a single `1` and `-1`, then the reduced row echelon form will tell you exactly wich variables are equal to a canonical vairable.

If our graph was a bunch of points connected by springs, these eigvenctors are normal mods that correspond to an entire connected chunk translating uniformly. Or you could think of the graph as a circuit and the edges as resistors in which case it corresponds to the shifting of an entire chunk by a uniform Voltage, and no current flows.

One of the cool things about spectral graph theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory> is that it tells you an approximation of the min cut

However, you are free to use more complicated linear combinations.

Subsumption is a terminology for a redundant fact

Forward subsumption  is deleting new redundant inferences. We need to compare a new fact and see if it is made redundant by our large database of old facts

Backward subsumption is the opposite. We want to see which pieces of our old big datbase are made redunant by our new fact

If I knew x > 0 and then derive x > -1, this new fact is redundant.
If I knew x > 0 and derive x > 1, then the old fact x > 0 is made redundant. The new fact is strictly stronger.

Some common notions of subsumption

- conditional facts with weaker assumtions. `A /\ B => C` is strictly weaker than `A => C`
- intervals
- Unification patterns. `forall A, f(A)= g(A)` is stronger than `f(1) = g(1)`. Likewise `forall A B, g(A,B) = 7` is stronger than `forall A, g(A,A) = 7`
- Linear equations
- Linear Inequalities
- Polynomial equations
- Boolean formulas.

Forward subsumption of linear inequalities is answerable via linear programming. Given the database `Ax >= b`, is `cx >= d` redundant? Well the answer to `min cx s.t. Ax >= b` will tell you. If the min was already greater than d, it is redundant, and the dual vector tells you how to derive this fact

Forward Subsumption of boolean variables can be asked via a SAT query. We can have a big database and push and pop small queries on.

It is less clear to me how to do backward subsumption.

We can normalize

Grobner bases and guassian elimination
Duplicating inside z3.

$Ax=b$ This represents some affine subspace
Does this hyperplane
$cx=d$
lie inside the subspace?

$l(Ax - b) = cx - d$

The dual problem
$ lb=d $
$ lA=c $

So we could solve this via a stack matrix $l(A|b) = (c|d)$
Or we could do a block LU.

What are my options for decompositions. LU, QR, eigen, svd

Semiring considerations?

Union finds are used for connected components. You could use linear algebraic / spectral methods for connected components, although it would be ludicrous overkill. We are in some sense building things akin to the graph laplacian / differentiation operators. The adjacency matrix of the graph.

```python
class EGraph():
    nodes
    uf
    T
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = []
        self.R = []
        self.t = []
    def add_term(self, t):

    def canon()
        
```

```python
cos(sin(x)**2)**2 + sin(1 - cos(x)**2)**2


```

```python
import numpy as np

R = np.array([
    [1,-1,0,0,0],
    [0,1,-1,0,0],
    [0,0,0,1,-1]
])
np.linalg.svd(R)
np.linalg.qr(R)

```

    QRResult(Q=array([[1., 0., 0.],
           [0., 1., 0.],
           [0., 0., 1.]]), R=array([[ 1., -1.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  1., -1.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  1., -1.]]))

```python

```

$\displaystyle \left[\begin{matrix}1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0\end{matrix}\right]$

```python
S[:,5:] # This is directly the row manipulation matrix. It tells us how to get the row normalized form from R.
```

$\displaystyle \left[\begin{matrix}1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\0 & 1 & -1 & 0\end{matrix}\right]$

The wyaso f looking at matrix multiplication. Row times column, sure, but also a vectior can be seen as a column sum of a matrix. A row vector on the right is a row sum.

RA = row manipulations / linear row sums of A. Each row of R is a Row sum recipe.  

`E * [R | I] = [E*R | E] = S`

We want to know how .
Can I produce a spanning tree from this? Well, I can get a subset of the edges needed.

Each row of the reduced row echelon can be seen as a rewrite rule. The leading 1 should rewrite to the negative of the rest of that row.
`[1 0 -1 -1]` is seen as `x_0 -> x_2 + x_3`. The term ordering of the variable of the obvious one.

Polynomials (and many mathemtical expressions) can be seen in two different lights.

- `1 + 2a + b*b`  `a` and `b` have particular values in a model. They are points. They are ground. They can perhaps be solved for.  R^2 -> P
- `1 + 2*A + B*B`  A thing you're suppose to subsitute in for variables A,B. This is a mapping to a scalar and a pluggable formula for it. "Solving" an equation would be finding a surface. In particular you may want a parametrization of the surface. P -> R. Or is this R^2 -> R?

Is grobner basis finding ground completion? Yes, I think so.

Creating S polynomials is creating critical pairs. But we aren't doing unification of monomials. We are doing sub term finding (?). Well possibly subterm into an even bigger thing. What if we restricted grobner to strict monominal subterm S polynomials (one of the monomial coefficients has to be 1)?  x^{m} - p x^{n}

Quine Mclucskey is also completion? How does that one work?

Polynomials are just another container.
bottom up ematching still seems ok
polynomials are ground from the term reqwriting perspective.
grobner guaranteed to terminate?
Also linear equalities

We can also do SMT guarded patterns.

linear inequalities?

Note that a grobner basis over linear equations is guassian elimuination.
But also a grobner basis over linear equations of the form `p = q` is sufficient to make a union find.
Hence we can use grobner instead of our union find.

Triangular substitutions a la minkanren for unification. Triangular is reminiscent of LU decomposition. There are incremental guassian elimination algorithms.
