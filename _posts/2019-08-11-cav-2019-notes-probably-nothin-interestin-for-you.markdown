I went to the opening workshops of CAV 2019 in New York this year (on my own dime mind you!) after getting back from joining Ben on the long trail for a bit. The tutorials on Rosette and Liquid Haskell were really fun. Very interesting technology. Also got some good ramen and mochi pudding, so it's all good. Big Gay Ice Cream was dece.

We also have type level lambdas.
refinement polymorphism

LH is somewhat like singletons in the sense there is a manual reflection step.
In singletons the manual reflection is in the Sing type
in LH it is kind of all over the place. (+) has a type. Where is it defined?


How does it know that the Haskell function + is the same as the SMT solver function?

Coq and Agda and Idris type checking is powered quite a bit by an internal unification engine
explicit annotation may lessen the burden somewhat

SMT solvers as a unification engine
structure unification vs uninterpeted functions.
f a ~ Int is not a valid Haskell constraint. Maybe with the unmatchable arrow it is?
In a funny sense, there is a difference between  Just and (+ 1). 
One being a constructor means we can match out of it
Just :: a ->> b
(+ 1) :: Int -> Int

-- test' :: (f a ~ Int) => ()

Liquid Haskell - What is?

another thing we could do is galois connections between refinements. Pos, Zero, Neg <-> Int

Liquid Haskell uses SMT solvers to resolve it's type checking requirements.

Agda et al also work very much via unification. Unification is a broad term but it's true.

It also has a horn clause solver for inference. Every language needs some kind of inference or you'd go insane. Also it is piggybacking on haskell

It's not as magical as I thought? Like seeing the magicians trick. It really does understand haskell code. Like it isn't interpretting it. When it knows facts about how (+) works, that is because the refined type was put in by hand in the prelude connecting it to SMT facts. What is imported by liquid haskell?

The typing environment is clutch. You need to realize what variables are in scope and what their types are, because that is all the SMT can use to push through type checking requirements.

Installing the stack build worked for me. It takes a while . I couldn't get cabal install to work, because I am not l33t.

Uninterpeted functions. Unmatchability?

It wouldn't be haskell without a bunch of compiler directives. It is somewhat difficult to find in a single cohesive place what all the syntax, and directives are from liquid haskell. Poking around it best.

[http://goto.ucsd.edu/~nvazou/presentations/](http://goto.ucsd.edu/~nvazou/presentations/) presentations. They are fairly similar to one another.

Liquid haskell gives us the ability to put types on stuff that wasn't possible before.

Linearity :: f :: {a -> b | f (s ^*a) == s ^* (f a) }

Pullback. {(a,b) | f a == g b}

Equalizer

Many things in categoruy theory rely on the exists unique. Do we have functiona extensionality in Liquid haskell?

product : {(a,b) | f q = x, g q = y,  =>   }

Pushing the boundaries on what liquid haskell can do sounds fun.

Equalizer. The eqaulizer seems prominents in sheaves. Pre-sheaves are basically functors. Sheaves require extra conditions. Restriction maps have to work? Open covers seem important

type Equalizer f g a b = {(e :: a , eq :: a -> b) | f (eq e) = g (eq e) }

I think both the type a and eq are special. e is like an explcit parametrization.  

type Eq f g a = {e :: a | f e = g e} I think this is more in the spirit. Use f and g both as measures.

presheaf is functor. But then sheaf is functor that

(a, Eq (F a) (G a)). typelevel equalizer? All types a that F and G agree on.

Records are sheaves - Jon Sterling. Records have subtyping. This gives you a toplogy feeling thing.

<https://www.slideshare.net/jonsterling/galois-tech-talk-vinyl-records-in-haskell-and-type-theory>  

What about purescript records?

{foo | a} {bar | a} -> intersection = {foo bar | b} can inhabit either

union is
or do you want closed records? union is union of fields. intersection is intersection of fields.

In this case a cover would be a set of records with possibly overlapping fields whose combined labels cover the whle space we want to talk about. consistency condition of sheaf/equalizer is that overlapping records fields have to match. I guess { q.foo = r.foo  } ?There is a way to combine all the stuff up. This is exactly what Ghrist was getting at with tables. Tables with shared columns.

data R1 = R1 {foo :: Int, bar :: Int}

{ (r1 :: R1, r2 :: R2) | (foo r1) = (foo r2) } -- we manitain duplicates across records.

Through NDArray overloading, a significant fragment of numpy code is probably verifiable.

Start with functional arithmetic programs.

Need to inspect function annotations to know how to build input type.  

@verify() tag

Use (Writer a) style monad.  

If statements are branching. We are again approaching inspecting functions via probing. But what if we lazily probe. At every __bool__ point, we run a z3 program to determine if there is an avaiable bool left possible (we don't need to inspect dead code regions. Also would be cool to mention it is a dead region). Curious. We're reflecting via Z3.

Loops present a problem. Fixed loops are fine. but what about loops that depend on the execution? for i in range(n). I guess again we can hack it...? Maybe. range only takes an integer. we don't have overload access.

Maybe we need to go into a full eval loop. utterly deconstructing the function and evaluating it statelemnt by statement.  

(compare :: a -> a -> Comparison). We could select a choice based on if there is a new one avaialable. Requires access to external store. We lose the thread. How can we know a choice was made? How can we know what the choice was? Did it ask var1 or var2? We can probably do it in python via access to a global store. But in haskell?

while loops take invariant annotations.

It would be cool to have a program that takes

pre conditions. Post ocnditions, but then also a Parameter keyword to declare const variables as deriveable.  exists parameter. forall x precondition x => post condition.

Parameter could be of a type to take a dsl of reasonable computations. Perhaps with complexity predicates. and then interpretting the parameter defines the computation.

Or simpler case is parameter is an integer. a magic number.
