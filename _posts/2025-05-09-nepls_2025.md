I gave a short 20 minute talk at the New England Programming Languages and Systems Symposium on <https://nepls.org/Events/35/> on Knuckledragger <https://github.com/philzook58/knuckledragger>, a low barrier proof assistant I've been writing in python heavily based around Z3 .

You can try out the talk yourself on Colab here.

I recorded a practice version of the talk. Practice makes perfect, my guy.

Greg quite nicely took a picture of me while I presenting. It's good to have mementos

Some highlight other talks from the conference for me were:

- CoPy: Declarative Objected-oriented programming through copatterns. Really interesting way to extend python to include copatterns
- Zero-Cost Lexical Effect Handlers
- Rust isnâ€™t a Silver Bullet for Systems Research (Yet).
- From Linearity to Borrowing. An interesting formal calculus for explaining borrowing.

I may have stilled been a little adrenalined up to give the morning talks their fair shake
