title: Don't Implement Unification by Recursion
date: 2024-10-28
---

[Unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)) is formal methods speak for solving equations.

The most common form of unification discussed is first order syntactic unification. When it succeeds, it solves a pile of equations no matter what the actual functions represent.

`[exists ?X ?Y] foo(bar(?X)) = foo(?Y)` has a solution `[forall ?Y ?X] ?Y = bar(?X)`. Or `cos(sin(?X)) = cos(?Y)` has a solution `?Y = sin(?X)`. From the perspective of first order unification, it doesn't matter what `cos` and `sin` mean.

Actually implementing unification, similar to most other algorithms that manipulate variables, is kind of the bane of my existence. I avoid it at extreme cost.

It is somewhat surprising that unification is cleaner and easier to implement in an loopy imperative mutational style than in a recursive functional pure style. Typically theorem proving / mathematical algorithms are much cleaner in the second style in my subjective opinion. Unification has too much spooky action at a distance, a threaded state, and can usefully use access to the stack in the form a todo queue to canonize it or reorder it.

A recursion form can be convenient if you need to rebuild a term after you're done doing whatever you're doing. In the manual todo list form, you'll need to store a zipper of some kind to replicate that. Unification typically only returns a substitution and not the original inputs terms specialized to the substitution (although this would be useful for critical pairs, narrowing etc). So for unification, this benefit of recursion is not so useful.

# Pattern Matching

Unification can be seen as two sided pattern matching. Pattern matching (like python's new match-case construct) takes in some tree and allows you to match it against patterns. Patterns maybe contain variables, and when the pattern matches, that branch of the `case` has the variables bound. Unification allows you to match patterns against patterns. In one possible low level implementation, the variables are refcells. Unification works via pointer manipulation, pointing the refcell to a piece of a tree or another refcell. It'd be neat and possible for a low level language like rust to support pointer based unification as something akin to a match statement. In logic programming languages, we typically have both unification and backtracking. These aren't intrinsically coupled features.

Anyway, pattern matching is much easier to implement. Let's take a look to make a point about recursive vs iterative implementations.

Like many algorithms, there is a recursive and iterative version. The iterative version more or less reifies the call stack of the recursive version into a normal data structure, keeping around a queue of thins to do.

You can also choose whether to manipulate the substitution you're building purely functionally or mutationally.

```python
# I'm going to work over the z3py ast, because it's useful for knuckledragger and it avoids defining some arbitrary ast.
from z3 import *
def pmatch(pat, t):
    subst = {}
    def worker(pat, t):
        if is_var(pat):
            if pat in subst:
                return subst[pat].eq(t)
            else:
                subst[pat] = t
                return True
        if is_app(pat):
            if is_app(t) and pat.decl() == t.decl():
                return all(worker(pat.arg(i), t.arg(i)) for i in range(pat.num_args()))
            return False
    if worker(pat, t):
        return subst

# I'm sort of abusing z3's Var here. It's meant for de bruijn vars
x,y,z = Var(0,IntSort()), Var(1,IntSort()), Var(2,IntSort())
assert pmatch(IntVal(3), IntVal(3)) == {}
assert pmatch(IntVal(3), IntVal(4)) == None
assert pmatch(x, IntVal(3)) == {x : IntVal(3)}
assert pmatch(x + x, IntVal(3) + IntVal(4)) == None
assert pmatch(x + x, IntVal(3) + IntVal(3)) == {x : IntVal(3)}
assert pmatch(x + y, IntVal(3) + IntVal(4)) == {x : IntVal(3), y : IntVal(4)}
```

But we can also write this in a loopy todo list form.

```python
from z3 import *
def pmatch_loop(pat, t):
    subst = {}
    todo = [(pat, t)]
    while todo:
        pat, t = todo.pop()
        if is_var(pat):
            if pat in subst:
                if not subst[pat].eq(t):
                    return None
            else:
                subst[pat] = t
        elif is_app(pat):
            if not is_app(t) or pat.decl() != t.decl():
                return None
            todo.extend(zip(pat.children(), t.children())) 
    return subst

assert pmatch_loop(IntVal(3), IntVal(3)) == {}
assert pmatch_loop(IntVal(3), IntVal(4)) == None
assert pmatch_loop(x, IntVal(3)) == {x : IntVal(3)}
assert pmatch_loop(x + x, IntVal(3) + IntVal(4)) == None
assert pmatch_loop(x + x, IntVal(3) + IntVal(3)) == {x : IntVal(3)}
assert pmatch_loop(x + y, IntVal(3) + IntVal(4)) == {x : IntVal(3), y : IntVal(4)}
```

# Inference Rules to the Loop

Unification can be presented as an inference system.

Inference rules as compared to pseudocode are nice sometimes. They make things feel mathier. They can make it clear that there is choice available on how to proceed. If you know prolog, rules are cool in that you can write them down as prolog clauses.

The huge downsides of inference rules is that they are a barrier to entry, and the leap from rules to any sort of implementable algorithm can be very non trivial.

If I write unification with a LIFO queue, FIFO queue or some other ordering, it doesn't matter much. And this can matter in more complex unification domains  (E-unification and higher order unification) where you can get locally stumped on how to proceed, so it can be fruitful to pick off of you todo list the easiest to solve equation.

from [TRAAT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/280474) chapter 4

`delete` remove a trivial equation, `decompose` matches heads and then zips together their children, `orient` puts variables in the lhs, `eliminate` takes an equation in solved for and substitues the solution everywhere.

A `todo` queue is basically our multiset `S` and we choose a particular order to process the equations.
We end up with something like this.

```python
def occurs(x, t):
    if is_var(t):
        return x.eq(t)
    if is_app(t):
        return any(occurs(x, t.arg(i)) for i in range(t.num_args()))
    return False

def unify(p1,p2):
    subst = {}
    todo = [(p1,p2)]
    while todo:
        p1,p2 = todo.pop() # we could pop _any_ of the todos, not just the top.
        if p1.eq(p2): # delete
            continue
        elif is_var(p1): # elim
            if occurs(p1, p2):
                return None
            todo = [(substitute(t1,(p1,p2)), substitute(t2,(p1,p2))) for (t1,t2) in todo]
            subst = {k : substitute(v, (p1,p2)) for k,v in subst.items()}
            subst[p1] = p2
        elif is_var(p2): # orient
            todo.append((p2,p1))
        elif is_app(p1): # decompose
            if not is_app(p2) or p1.decl() != p2.decl():
                return None
            todo.extend(zip(p1.children(), p2.children())) 
        else:
            raise Exception("unexpected case", p1, p2)
    return subst

x,y,z = Var(0,IntSort()), Var(1,IntSort()), Var(2,IntSort())
assert unify(IntVal(3), IntVal(3)) == {}
assert unify(IntVal(3), IntVal(4)) == None
assert unify(x, IntVal(3)) == {x : IntVal(3)}
assert unify(x, y) == {x : y}
assert unify(x + x, y + y) == {x : y}
assert unify(x + x, y + z) == {x : y, z : y}
assert unify(x + y, y + z) == {x : z, y : z}
assert unify(y + z, x + y) == {y : x, z : x}
# non terminating if no occurs check
assert unify((x + x) + x, x + (x + x)) == None
assert unify(1 + x, x) == None
```

# Eager vs Lazy Substitution

You can wait to remove the solved for variables from your `todo` expressions. There is a lot of wasteful passes doing nothing in the eager method where I immediately eliminate `x` everywhere as soon as it is solved.

The lazy method also becomes basically required if you write in a recursive functional style since you do not have access to the `todo` queue that is on your call stack.

The lazy method is a bit more confusing IMO.

There is also a choice about whether to canonize your substitutions as you use them. The is the analog of path compression in a union find. You can also choose to keep your substitutions in a triangular form where your substitution mapping is never normalized, but then you need to apply it recursively until a fixed point. This style is made popular by [minikanren](http://minikanren.org/).

```python
def unify_lazy(p1,p2):
    subst = {}
    todo = [(p1,p2)]
    def lookup_var(v):
        while v in subst:
            v = subst[v]
        return v
    def lookup_term(t):
        if is_var(t):
            t = lookup_var(t)
        if is_var(t):
            return t
        if is_app(t):
            return t.decl()(*[lookup_term(c) for c in t.children()])
    while todo:
        p1,p2 = todo.pop()
        p1,p2 = lookup_term(p1), lookup_term(p2)
        if p1.eq(p2):
            continue
        elif is_var(p1): # elim
            if occurs(p1, p2):
                return None
            subst[p1] = p2
        elif is_var(p2): # orient
            todo.append((p2,p1))
        elif is_app(p1): # decompose
            if not is_app(p2) or p1.decl() != p2.decl():
                return None
            todo.extend(zip(p1.children(), p2.children())) 
        else:
            raise Exception("unexpected case", p1, p2)
    return subst

x,y,z = Var(0,IntSort()), Var(1,IntSort()), Var(2,IntSort())
assert unify_lazy(IntVal(3), IntVal(3)) == {}
assert unify_lazy(IntVal(3), IntVal(4)) == None
assert unify_lazy(x, IntVal(3)) == {x : IntVal(3)}
assert unify_lazy(x, y) == {x : y}
assert unify_lazy(x + x, y + y) == {x : y}
assert unify_lazy(x + x, y + z) == {x : z, z : y}
assert unify_lazy(x + y, y + z) == {x : z, y : z}
assert unify_lazy(y + z, x + y) == {z : y, y : x}
assert unify_lazy(y + z, x - y) == None
```

# Recursive Form

Finally here is the recursive form. All the looking up and the laziness is what makes it confusing to me.
This is basically the lazy iterative form turned back into recursion.

Note that we have kind of removed the ability to inspect which equation in our todo to process next. We are forced to pick some order and then maybe retrieve that ordering by some wacky continuation thing or returning frozen constraints or something.

```python
def unify_rec1(p1,p2, subst):
    def lookup_var(v):
        while v in subst:
            v = subst[v]
        return v
    def lookup_term(t):
        if is_var(t):
            t = lookup_var(t)
        if is_var(t):
            return t
        if is_app(t):
            return t.decl()(*[lookup_term(c) for c in t.children()])
    p1,p2 = lookup_term(p1), lookup_term(p2)
    if p1.eq(p2):
        return subst
    elif is_var(p1): # elim
        if occurs(p1, p2):
            return None
        return {**subst, p1 : p2}
    elif is_var(p2): # orient
        return unify_rec1(p2,p1, subst)
    elif is_app(p1): # decompose
        if not is_app(p2) or p1.decl() != p2.decl():
            return None
        for c in zip(p1.children(), p2.children()):
            subst = unify_rec1(c[0], c[1], subst)
            if subst is None:
                return None
    else:
        raise Exception("unexpected case", p1, p2)
    return subst
def unify_rec(p1,p2):
    return unify_rec1(p1,p2,{})

x,y,z = Var(0,IntSort()), Var(1,IntSort()), Var(2,IntSort())
assert unify_rec(IntVal(3), IntVal(3)) == {}
assert unify_rec(IntVal(3), IntVal(4)) == None
assert unify_rec(x, IntVal(3)) == {x : IntVal(3)}
assert unify_rec(x, y) == {x : y}
assert unify_rec(x + x, y + y) == {x : y}
assert unify_rec(x + x, y + z) == {x : y, y : z}
assert unify_rec(x + y, y + z) == {x : y, y : z}
assert unify_rec(y + z, x + y) == {y : x, z : x}
```

I don't know what I'm doing. Do not take this blog post as gospel.

"Don't implement unification by recursion" is an aggressive way of saying. It's more "Consider not using recursion".

Also it's nice to have the ability to fail the unification by `return None` instead of raising an error or option monading it. I have come full circle to "write the fucking loop" I guess. All my beloved functional programming has failed me. My cities in tatters. Sigh.

# Union Find

The pure var to var part of `subst` is being used as a union find

THis is  the find operation

```
    def lookup_var(v):
        while v in subst:
            v = subst[v]
        return v
```

Union finds can be implemented in different styles. An arena style or a refcell/pointer style.

# Occurs Check

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occurs_check>

I'm not sure where the idea that the occurs check is the "correct" thing to do and that we only avoid it as a near sighted optimization.

It is an interesting perspective and it is true for things like lists.

There is a related thing to the occurs check, which is correct scoping of forall and exists variables. Curiously, you can make the occurs check deal with this by making all the existential variables in scope parameters to a fresh forall variable in a goal. This is disccussed in the addendum here <https://www.philipzucker.com/harrop-checkpoint/> and the Otten provers <https://jens-otten.de/tutorial_cade19/> . The occurs check will then detect an ill scoping. <https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/66068.66075>

But for many other function symbols in the theorem proving context, it is perfectly natural to have a loopy equation. `pow(?X, 2) = ?X` has the solution of `1`. It is not an inconsistent thing to ask for. Nor is it an inconsistent universal thing to assert. It is saying multiplication is absorptive, like in boolean algebra.

Also, if we are "scientists" about it, we can take observation it is simpler to just not write the occurs check as evidence that unification is kind of naturally coinductive / loopy / observational / non-well-founded.

# Egraph / Flat Style

An interesting style for doing unification is to maintain two mappings.

`var -> option obs` and a `var -> var` union find

I discussed this more here. <https://www.philipzucker.com/coegraph/>

You can process the equations quite lazily. The thing is very uniform. Also you can do bisimulation reduction and "hashcons" equivalent rational terms. The observation table is exactly what you need to do the automata minimization.

## Inference Rules

There are a couple different ways to interpret inference rules into code.

We may have one function that has ~one case per inference rule
Or we may write a function per inference rule
The inference rules may recuyrsively call other inference rules.

We may choose which pieces are inputs and outputs of the rule

1. Bottom comes in, top comes out
2. top comes in, bottoms come out
3. some combo of top and bottom come out

```python
def delete(S):
    t,t1 = S.pop()
    assert t.eq(t1)
    return S

def decompose(S):
    t,t1 = S.pop()
    assert is_app(t) and is_app(t1) and t.decl() == t1.decl()
    S.extend(zip(t.children(), t1.children()))
    return S

def orient(S):
    t,x = S.pop()
    assert is_var(x) and not is_var(t)
    S.append((x, t))

def elim(S):
    x,t = S.pop()
    S = [    ]
    return S

# S is a multiset
def permute(S, perm):
    return [S[perm[i]] for i in range(len(S))]
```

## other

I am disturbed by the number of times I've already written posts about unification, and yet don't feel that much wiser

I have no memory of this one <https://www.philipzucker.com/unification-in-julia/>

<https://www.philipzucker.com/resolution1/> This was pretty recent. I wrote the same style unification here that I learned from PyRes.

In unification, we talk about "unification variables". "unification variables"  can really refer to things that are very very different.

In theorem proving, there is both forward inference, deriving new theorems from axioms, or backward inference, breaking down goals into easier goals.

Goals and axioms/theorems are very different. Goals are things we want to show are true. Axioms are things we assert true. Unification variables in goals are implicitly existentially quantifier. Unification variables in axioms are implicitly universally quantified.

In prolog, the variables you enter at the prompt are existentially quantified. The variables in the rules and the answers are universally quantified. Running the prolog program converts these existentially quantified questions into universally quantified answers.

## variable freshening and context

- Sometimes you want to unify two things where the variables are disjoint even if variable names are shared. This is for example the case when unifying two literals from different clauses, or a prolog goal against a prolog rule head. Just because I wrote `foo(Y,X) :- bar(X).` under the query `?- foo(X, Y)` should not imply `X = Y`. Implicitly there is a binding at the head of the rule `forall x y, foo(y,x) :- bar(x).`.
- Sometimes you want to unify two things where the variables can overlap. This is what happens when you apply the factoring rule inside a single clause.

You can freshen all the variables to turn a routine for the second case into the first. Freshening may be a reason to inlcude an integer id in your variable datatype. Still this is pretty clunky and ugly.

Another option is to pass in two extra ctx parameters to unify and every variable is understood with respect to them. Then the second case comes from the first if the two ctx are aliased.

Python is a very imperative language. It doesn't have good easy access immutable data structures. Basically making a whole new copy of lists or dicts is the only good option. This also informs what is the easiest style to write.

Substitution mapping considered as rewrite rules.

uniification  as observation
unification as fixed point - When written as an inference system this espcailly makes sense.

Lazy vs eager substitution in unification

Tringular = Lazy

Eager vs lazy normalization of union find.

Recursive vs loop.
We have access to the "todo" equations in loop form in the form of some kind of stack.

Inference rule form.
I kind of feel like completion you're moving from E to S, building a valid substitution. E;S.
Inference rule form is closer to loop form. You have access to all of E.
Typical loop form just pops, but you could use a loop to find the next one to deal with.

Logical Form.
Exists([x,y,z], T) == Exist([x,y,z], T)
Exists([], T1 = T2)
ForAll([], ) # rigid.

occursw check vs scope escape. That prolog trick
Just having Exists and ForAll might give you a variation of miller. Ignore lambda?

# Z3 Unify

Unification is useful for question asking (exists)
and for inferring new facts

questions ~ goals ~ queries ~ BoolRef ~ typed at prolog repl ~ prolog call
answers ~ solutions ~ Proof ~ returned to prolog repl ~ prolog return

questions can be forall or exists
answers can also be forall or exists

bottom up ho unify is simpler. Dowek. Maybe anmm inverse method/magic set is in order.
